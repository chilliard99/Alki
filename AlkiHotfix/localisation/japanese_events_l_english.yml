 southerncitymission_events.1001.t: "Our Permanent Home"
 southerncitymission_events.1001.d: "The city of Tokyo has continuously been the center of the Southern Cities. Now that we have formed this union we have a choice to either change history or stay with it. On one hand owning the city of Tokyo would give us a legitimacy unrivaled amongst the rest of the isle, but on the other we are not the Reiwans. So then our choice is simple, stay where we are or move our base of operations to the new city."
 southerncitymission_events.1001.a: "We shall adopt Tokyo"
 southerncitymission_events.1001.b: "We will strike a new path"
 southerncitymission_events.1002.t: "The Delagate from Hokuriku"
 southerncitymission_events.1002.d: "The delegate stumbles across the room and places a tightly gripped scroll onto the table. On it is written the text of a proposed diplomatic union between the Southern Cities and the kingdom of Hokuriku. The delegate speaks from the position of a small bureaucrat, but assures us that there is great support for his movement amongst the nobility. Our own diplomats begin to shout claims of foul play. They state that this is simply a ploy for the Hokurikans to get their own upper hand on the Southern Cities and that we should do well to ignore the hours of negotiations. It is now our time to choose, play the game of the Hokurikans or forge our own path."
 southerncitymission_events.1002.a: "The Hokurikans are an honest bunch"
 southerncitymission_events.1002.b: "We are better alone"
 southerncitymission_events.1003.t: "Sedition Amongst the Nobility"
 southerncitymission_events.1003.d: "Our own state now begins to betray us. A number of bureaucrats have been unimpressed by our tenuous position and have gone behind our backs to craft a deal with the southern cities. Normally, this would be an easy thing to dispel, but the sheer number of officials behind this conspiracy is too great. The resulting slaughter would be too much. The king of the Southern Cities has extended a hand to us for a diplomatic alliance in which they would hold the lion’s share of the power. Should we go forward and bend our knee or strike at them with ferocity?"
 southerncitymission_events.1003.a: "Perhaps this is for the best"
 southerncitymission_events.1003.b: "My Kingdom will not fall that easily"
 southerncitymission_events.1004.t: "A Return Message"
 southerncitymission_events.1004.d: "A hushed tone falls upon the throne room as that same young delegate unfurls the message from the Hokurikans and begins to read. The note is brief and expresses a begrudging gratitude. A festival is held the next day with a great number of officials from both governments sharing merry times of this new union. The rest of the isle looks onwards for what this new power to rival the Ainu is capable of."
 southerncitymission_events.1004.a: "A Glorious Day!"
 southerncitymission_events.1005.t: "A Return Message"
 southerncitymission_events.1005.d: "A hushed tone falls upon the throne room as that same young delegate unfurls the message from the Hokurikans and begins to read. The note is brief and expresses a violent anger at the request. Further, the note speaks specifically of the man reading it and news of his co-conspirators. This faction of bureaucrats is only to face fury upon their return and the man’s family has been taken as they await his return. However this maneuver has left the Hokurikans open to retaliation as we can use their brutality as a means to restore order to a disorder filled region."
 southerncitymission_events.1005.a: "Fools"
 southerncitymission_events.1006.t: "The City of Odin"
 southerncitymission_events.1006.d: "Our men rushed into the city, first taking down the primitive wooden walls and then marching down the streets. Instead of the home of the gods, we found poverty and an endless assault. Women, children, and the elderly tried stopping our advance. Equipped with whatever they could find, they assailed our men as we took the city. The core of the city was rumored to have that old god chained up and contained, but when our men made it to the center they found no such thing. Instead they found a mess of bodies strewn across the town square in piles. Thousands of bodies of those slain in combat and those who fell from the plague. The city now was nothing more than a plagued vessel actively hostile to our precense. We face a choice in how to move forward. We can either torch the city and rebuild on the ashes of this fertile land, or we could leave the city to the pagans."
