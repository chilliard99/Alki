 beauty_of_rainier_yakama: "Beauty of Rainier"
 beauty_of_rainier_yakama_desc: "Within the steep Cascades there is one peak whose majesty stretches above all others: Rainier. Near its base lies the ancient and abandoned city of Tahoma. Centuries ago, when the Yakamans ruled over the lands of Washington, Tahoma served as the capital of their grand empire. Its columned walls protected the people from invasion by the Americans and barbarous tribes of the north. Despite its majestic defenses, nothing could prevent the city’s ultimate downfall by the mountain itself. A terrible eruption spilled magma into the city streets and darkened the sky above. Most citizens fled, leaving Tahoma a ruined husk. The Yakamans still venture to the ruins of their great capital to train talented young soldiers."
 chairman_authority_yakama: "Chairman Authority"
 chairman_authority_yakama_desc: "Like most Trueheir confederacies, the Yakaman Confederacy was composed of not just one band, but a collection of distinct ones that each held their own cultural traditions. While the Yakaman band is the largest and most powerful in the Confederacy, it also includes the Klickitat, Palus, Wallawalla, Wanapam, Wenatchee, and Wishram. To guide all of these different groups, the Confederacy allows the chieftain of the most powerful band to take on the title of chairman. The chairman is absolute in their authority, allowed to do whatever they believe will be best for the Yakamans as a whole."
 piitliyawila_yakama: "Piitl'iyawilá"
 piitliyawila_yakama_desc: "In Yakaman society, each elder was expected to provide some members of their family to assist in the defense of the confederacy. These Piitl'iyawilá would often be selected from birth to fill this role and were trained in the position for most of their lives. The presence of a readily available warrior class helped the confederacy fend off foes far larger than them multiple times throughout their history."
 yakima_chardonnay_yakama: "Yakima Chardonnay"
 yakima_chardonnay_yakama_desc: "The Yakamans have a long history tracing back to the time of the American empire. Americans living in the province of Oregon would often trade gold to the Yakamans for essential goods like grain or lumber. Over time, the Americans introduced the Yakamans to their love of wine. This new taste drove an elder in the Wallawalla band to create his own vineyard in the Yakama valley. The area’s perfect climate and rich soil gave the wines he produced a distinct taste which became highly desired among the Americans. Yakaman wines have come to define the confederacy to most outside of Washington. Yakaman vintages are enjoyed by members of high society across the entire continent."
 shyakla_yakama: "Shyaklá"
 shyakla_yakama_desc: "Among the Piitl'iyawilá there are a select few who are trained to become Shyaklá, or scouts. Learning to quickly travel through the land and subtly observe the movements of their enemies, the Shyaklá are the intel gatherers of the Yakama. In battle they attempt to flank the enemy while they engage with the Piitl'iyawilá. The lightning quick speed which they surround enemies with is usually enough to make them surrender. The adoption of rifles only made the Shyaklá more deadly as they were trained from an early age to quickly reload and take deadly aim."
 sahaptin_yakama: "Sahaptin"
 sahaptin_yakama_desc: "Each band of the Yakaman confederacy had its own traditions, culture, and most of the time its own language. Such a wide variety of different tongues necessitated the creation of an intermediary language. Sahaptian, a language common among Trueheirs of both Oregon and Washington, came to serve this purpose. Using Sahaptain, the Yakamans could converse with their brothers further south. As the confederacy slowly took on a more prominent role in the union, other Trueheir nations followed them in learning to speak the language. Soon, Sahaptain became the lingua franca of communication between Trueheir counties the Union over."
 band_unity_yakama: "Band Unity"
 band_unity_yakama_desc: "The Confederacy is more than just some loose political bond between a collection of chieftains, it is truly a connection between families. The bonds formed by Confederacy allow for the survival and prosperity of each of the bands in turn. Without the chairman’s guidance, each band would be too small and unorganized to defend itself. Together we are able to face any odds the Founder throws at us and survive."

There are primarily three groups that vie for power within each band: the Twatíwit, the Yalípt, and the Wiyánch'i.

 cultural_survival_yakama_desc: "Protections for the Trueheir people of California were originally established during American rule. The Imperial Senate passed the “Act of First Peoples” which prevented any lord or senator from attempting to take lands currently owned by Trueheir chieftains. This law was then passed to the new Californian kingdom when the province broke away. When the kingdom was abolished by the Franciscans, the Trueheirs who supported the first president lobbied for the law’s continuation. For over a millenia our people have been protected from those who wish to subjugate us, yet the War of the Mad revived fears that the Trueheirs may be at risk.

When the counts that decided to found the kingdom broke away from the Union during The War of the Mad, they invited our own confederacy to join their ranks. Many of our elders were open to this idea, but the offer was rescinded before any real conversation could occur.
