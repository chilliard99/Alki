 washington_ideas: "Washingtonian Ideas"
 washington_the_siren_league: "The Siren League"
 washington_the_siren_league_desc: "Washington was a vital part of commerce under the Californian Kingdom. Its steady ports helped produce the majority of the kingdom’s civilian and military vessels. The ruling lords of the time were notoriously hands off when it came to commercial matters which meant that most of the construction companies of the city were private enterprises. The shipbuilding market was mostly dominated by four different guilds who, in the year 621, decided to consolidate their organizations and form the Siren League. The League expanded over the following centuries, gradually taking over more maritime guilds until it dominated the entire market. The Siren League’s influence would come to define the history of California, contributing to the collapse of the Californian Kingdom and the rise of the Union."
 washington_a_northern_presidency: "A Northern Presidency"
 washington_a_northern_presidency_desc: "The Dach family, though they were extremely influential, never rose to the Presidency. Back in the day the office came with more constraints than power. Thanks to the gradual work of the Franciscans, this is no longer the case. California needs us now to take charge and lead the Union forward into this ever changing world."
 washington_cascadian_ambition: "Cascadian Ambition"
 washington_cascadian_ambition_desc: "Washington and Arborea served as the battlefield for multiple proxy conflicts during the 18th century. After the slow decline of the Alaskan communes and dissolution of the Union of California, the regions were left under the control of a series of tyrannical dukes. The American Empire and Eureka each backed their own collection of rulers for control over the region to prevent the other from gaining too much power. Disillusioned with their status as pawns in a game between world powers and inspired by the growing democratic movements of the east, citizens of Arborea and Washington raised arms against their dukes and united the two regions under a new Cascadian republic."
 washington_worlds_press: "World's Press"
 washington_worlds_press_desc: "Paper is vital for any administration. Laws, decrees, treaties, ledgers, and all manner of documents need to be jotted down somewhere. The local forests and mercantile culture made the Puget Sound a natural fit for creating and shipping this vital good along the Pacific Coast. Once the printing press became more widespread, demand for paper skyrocketed and many of the counts in Washington became wealthy beyond imagination."
 washington_diverse_military: "Diverse Military"
 washington_diverse_military_desc: "From Yakamans to Pugetites, from Lincolnites to Columbians, Washington is a region rich with diverse cultures and peoples. This pool of competing talent lends itself well to conflict. A military which can draw upon the best elements of its component peoples will fare much better than a homogenous one."
 washington_founders_protection: "Founder's Protection"
 washington_founders_protection_desc: "When the Anarchists and Despots came marching into Washington they were met with immediate and violent resistance. The region has always been dogmatic in their worship of The Founder. After the spread of the two breakaway Constitutionalist faiths in the south, Washington, alongside Baja, were left as the last bastions of the Partisan faith."
 washington_californian_industrialization: "Californian Industrialization"
 washington_californian_industrialization_desc: "Due to the lack of coal resources in California, Oregon, and Nevada, Washington was given an upper hand when the regions began modernization. Cascadian industrialization allowed the republic to grow exponentially and defend themselves from the bloodthirsty monarchists to their south and east. "

 dachia_ideas: "Dachian Ideas"
 dachia_chinese_entry: "Chinese Entry"
 dachia_chinese_entry_desc: "After a long Pacific voyage, Dachian ports would be the first place that most pioneers would stop before their journey continued. This status gave Dachia powerful control of trade within the Chinese Bay. Merchants would often just sell their goods to local lords at a heavily discounted price, too weary and cold to head out to sea anymore."
 dachia_hangang: "Hangang"
 dachia_hangang_desc: "The great river Hangang serves as the lifeblood of our state. When our settlers first arrived in this land we built our homes along its shores. For generations it has irrigated our farms and quenched our thirsts. Its natural power will drive our machines and feed our entire nation."
 dachia_manufacturing_hub: "Manufacturing hub"
 dachia_manufacturing_hub_desc: "While the rest of the Akilineq colonies were committed to tilling the land and growing cash crops, Dachia focused on production. By making the tools that pioneers needed closer to their homes, they could undercut their competition and rake in massive profits. Dachia slowly embraced this status as a new world supplier and became one of the most profitable new world colonies."
 dachia_californian_legacy: "Californian Legacy"
 dachia_californian_legacy_desc: "Alaska primarily used Californian explorers to travel east and chart the new world. The first Americans to set foot upon this great continent were Californians. Californians came to tame the wild lands of Dachia and Californians protected our homes from Collectivist oppression. No matter how hard they try, the Reds can never take our heritage."
 dachia_glory_in_freedom: "Glory in Freedom"
 dachia_glory_in_freedom_desc: "Sons and daughters of Dachia, we cannot continue to suffer under this colonial oppression. Our rights are not to be dictated by those across the sea! We will make our own freedom or die trying!"
 dachia_formidable_namesake: "Formidable Namesake"
 dachia_formidable_namesake_desc: "We must remember the cautionary tale of our namesake.. The Dachs freed their people from the tyrannical rule of the Californian King only to succumb to power hungry corruption. For our republic to thrive we must ensure that the people are never robbed of their rights. No one man should control all levers of governance."
 dachia_maritime_outlook: "Maritime Outlook"
 dachia_maritime_outlook_desc: "We have always been seafaring people. Our ancestors were brought here for their excellence in sailing the waves. For centuries we have traded goods along the shores of Akilineq and brought our fellow pioneers the tools they need to survive. The lessons of this great naval tradition spill over from one generation to the next, uniting young and old in an appreciation of the blue expanse."

 cascadia_a_beautiful_revolution_desc: "In the mills and fisheries, in the farmlands and factories, in the state houses and manors the people of Cascadia call out for their freedom. A single green flag will rise above all others and on it will stand a proud golden tree. Under its shade we will form a republic unlike any other. The people will dictate governance. The market will be liberated from the molestation of bureaucrats. Society will be completely free. Any corrupt monarch who wishes to stand in our way will be met with the fires of the masses. Rise up sons and daughters of Cascadia, let this beautiful revolution inspire all those who lie in bondage. Rise up and fight for our freedom!"
 cascadia_academic_culture: "Academic Culture"
 cascadia_academic_culture_desc: "The policy of a nation should be guided by rationality and the advice of experts. The old fools of Liberty fought against the academics instead of recognizing them as the powerful resource that they are. With their vast knowledge our nation will create policies that solve even the most difficult of modern issues. "
 cascadia_revolutionary_guard: "Revolutionary Guard"
 cascadia_revolutionary_guard_desc: "The existence of our nation is a threat to monarchies across the globe. If the people of their nations see the prosperity enjoyed by our common citizens, they will no doubt rise up and overthrow those that keep them subservient. Any day now the tyrants will come to harass us with their armies of evil. We must establish a robust army to defend the republic from all those who could threaten us."
 cascadia_monarchist_crusade: "Monarchist Crusade"
 cascadia_monarchist_crusade_desc: "Defense of our republic is one thing, but our true goal should be to liberate all those around the globe that still lie under bondage. Our righteous crusade against the monarchies of this world will not be driven by any religious convictions, but instead a deep love for our fellow man. Ready the weapons of war and rouse the soldiers, freedom waits for no one."
 cascadia_pacific_industry: "Pacific Industry"
 cascadia_pacific_industry_desc: "Cascadia was one of the first western nations to industrialize. Taking advantage of the most recent advancements coming out of the east, the Cascadians were able to completely dominate eastern markets with their manufacturing prowess. The Cascadian government worked with private corporations throughout the American continent to complete large scale projects like the Washington railroad and The Fuca Dam."
 cascadia_republican_league: "Republican League"
 cascadia_republican_league_desc: "There are a few nations which share our devotion to democratic ideals in the east. We should endeavor to enter into an alliance with them, so that neither of our great republics fall to the meddling of tyrannical monarchs. "
 cascadia_rights_of_the_citizen: "Rights of the Citizen"
 cascadia_rights_of_the_citizen_desc: "The rights of the citizens of the Cascadian state are enshrined within the republic’s constitution. Each citizen, no matter their nature, race, wealth, or creed, is given the right to vote, speak what they wish, worship their Gods, and raise concerns against the government. Such rights are granted to our countrymen by The Founder above. It is only fitting that they be protected within the very fabric of our nation."

However, among the settlers of the peninsula, the title Dachia has emerged. The name comes from the original colonial governor we placed in charge of the territory who hailed from the historic Dach family. The different names on domestic and foreign documents are starting to cause a headache for our administration. We ought to side with the settlers and switch over our references to Dachia."

 washington_events.8.d: "We have grown close to the Oregonians over our administration of their region, so the decision on whether or not to fully integrate them within our state has been a difficult one to decide. On one side of the debate we have a plan to keep them at a distance and prevent the Oregonians from having any say in how our nation functions. Alternatively we could grant their citizens the same rights as our own in Washington and allow the region to represent its own interests. Such a route could very well lead to the Oregonians overshadowing our own needs. We must be cautious in choosing either route to avoid such trappings."
 washington_events.8.a: "They are our brothers!"
 washington_events.8.b: "Washington should be our focus."
 washington_events.9.t: "Join or Die"
 washington_events.9.d: "While the Libertarians in the west are reluctant to acknowledge their soon to be conquered status, the Nevadans are not as ignorant. Many have come to [Root.Capital.GetName] and begged [Root.Monarch.GetName] to let their nation retain its independence. They know the futility of their task, yet they plead anyway. Some of our sharpest diplomats have reasoned from this that if we give the Nevadans a gracious way out of their predicament they will come to join our nation. The proposition is as follows: Join or Die. Either the nations can join us and maintain control of their lands under our nation or have their cities sieged. Sending out such a message will probably get at least a few positive responses."
 washington_events.9.a: "Offer them a way out."
 every_nation_in_nevada_can_join_us_as_vassal_or_integrate: "Every nation in the Nevada region will be given the option to be integrated or lose one stability."
 washington_events.10.t: "Join or Die."
 washington_events.10.d: "We have received a frightening message from [From.GetName]. The proposition is as follows: Join or Die. Either we can choose to join their expanding state or face all out war at the hands of their military. Even worse, this message was made public to our citizenry. Fearing for their lives and homes, many have called for us to accept their conditions. We must carefully consider how we wish to respond to this threat if we wish to maintain our independence."
 washington_events.10.a: "We choose to join."
 washington_events.10.b: "We will never surrender!"
