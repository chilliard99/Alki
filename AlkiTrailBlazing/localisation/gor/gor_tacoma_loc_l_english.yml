 destiny_millers_tacoma_desc: "Across the great treatises of the Classicalist movement you will find one common thread, not in the ideas they express or a characteristic of their author, but the material which the words are written upon. Cascadian paper has been a prominent industry in the region due to its abundance of local trees and many rivers. Under the leadership of the Alaskan Communes, the first Cascadian paper mill was established in the city of Tacoma in 1438. Mills similar to this quickly spread throughout the region and produced enough paper to keep the entire Union supplied for the duration of the Classicalist movement."
 the_peoples_populism_tacoma: "The People's Populism"
 the_peoples_populism_tacoma_desc: "While other counties of the UOC claimed to hold true Populist principles, the Democratic Republic of Tacoma attempted to fully implement what was described in the Constitution. The Democratic Republic featured no king, instead having a temporary Secretary who would head the nation for a period of four years. The Secretary was severely limited in their powers, allowed to only pause the passage of legislation from the common senate and raise an army for war."
 strike_proof_harbors_tacoma: "Strike-Proof Harbors"
 strike_proof_harbors_tacoma_desc: "In response to the Napan occupation of Seattle, the Alaskans declared a general strike on the Union of California. No Alaskans goods were allowed to flow into the union and in return the Alaskans would not accept any Californian goods. As Alaska slowly annexed the coastal territories of Arborea, this severely hampered trade in the north for the Washingtonians. While other counties turned their eyes south, Tacoma leveraged their Alaskan favor to become an exception to the strike. By embracing the Collectivist religion and entering into an alliance with Alaska, they were able to convince the nation to open up trade with their ports. From Tacoma, these goods would then be subtly shifted throughout the rest of Union."
 common_defense_tacoma: "Common Defense"
 common_defense_tacoma_desc: "Tacoma has long held close ties to the United Alaskan Communes. The city was initially selected as an administrative capital for the Washington region during The War of the Mad for its compliance. When the war ended and the Tacoman people attempted to rise up against their duke, the Alaskans were quick to offer a helping hand. Now that the Tacomans are surrounded by hungry states who wish to return their people to serfdom, the Alaskans have proclaimed a guarantee to protect the state."
 crimson_grit_tacoma: "Crimson Grit"
 crimson_grit_tacoma_desc: "The Crimson Grit is a mercenary company based out of the city of Tacoma. It originally served as the disciplinary hand of the Alaskan occupiers that sought out would-be rebels and snuffed out their revolutionary spirit. After the Treaty of Seattle restored union control to the region, the former members of the guard were left poor and without titles. Many of them raised up their arms again and began to contract their services out to whatever county needed assistance. Members of the company were present at nearly every conflict in the Union throughout the 15th century and fought bravely in the name of their buyers."
 peoples_republic_tacoma: "People's Republic"
 peoples_republic_tacoma_desc: "The Treaty of Seattle redefined the region of Washington under the guidance of the Union delegation and the Alaskan Communes. The city of Tacoma was given to the famed bankers of the house of Inslee as a neutral compromise. This gesture was met with hostile reactions from the denizens of the city, who universally hated the Inslees for their predatory practices. Nobles, clergy, and burghers marched together into the count’s manor and executed most of the royal family. In the resulting scramble for power between the three factions, the burghers were able to win out with the support of the Alaskans. They founded a new government, based on Collectivist and Partisan principles of Populism and Solidarity."

They asked him when the labor would end, when they would be allowed to rest and enjoy what they had created. The Builder placed his hand on one of their shoulders and said, “Look around you. Life has improved, comrades.

Once the way was opened for Californians to travel east and create new lives for themselves in these rich territories, hundreds of families picked up their bags and ran to the frontier. These new families became self reliant and adopted many of the traditional practices of the plainwalkers. In turn, the plainwalkers adopted many aspects of Californian culture. The fusion of these two groups founded a new identity: The Lincolnites. They named themselves after the ancient, and briefly lived, American territory of Lincoln in eastern Washington. The Lincolnites have grown to such an extent that the province of [dawn_of_lincolnite_culture.GetName] is now wholly under their control. While most of them are content to stay under our rule, some have begun to advocate for their own freedom and the creation of a Lincolnite governed kingdom."

 lincolnite_events.2.d: "The Lincolnite culture has spread to the province of [Root.GetName]. The influx of California settlers and subsequent fusion between the native Plainwalkers and the incoming pioneers’s culture has created an identity unique to [Root.GetName]. As we continue to take more land in East Washington away from the plainwalkers, the presence of this identity will no doubt grow. While most are satisfied with our rule, some have begun to advocate for the creation of their own Lincolnite kingdom. It would be wise to support this new identity and discourage any rebellious spirits."
