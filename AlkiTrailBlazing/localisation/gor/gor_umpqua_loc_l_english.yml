 cascadian_protection_umpqua: "Cascadian Protection"
 cascadian_protection_umpqua_desc: "The Cascades are a mountain range which cuts across Oregon and Washington, dividing the respective regions between east and west. The utter majesty of The Founder’s creation is evident to any individual who has laid eyes on the Cascades. Our nation has made great use of this sublime gift, taking advantage of the mountain’s natural strength to defend our populace from foreign invasion."
 southern_alliance_umpqua: "Southern Alliance"
 southern_alliance_umpqua_desc: "After The War of The Mad, Oregon’s eventual fate was decided by a coalition of prominent Traditionalist counts and the Napan President. Umpqua was established at the behest of the former party. The Umpqua family, from which our nation got its name, was known primarily for being the largest Traditionalist family in Oregon. The former Traditionalist dukes that ensured our state’s independence have kept in contact with our rulers and now seek to become our allies."
 traditionalist_stronghold_umpqua: "Traditionalist Stronghold"
 traditionalist_stronghold_umpqua_desc: "Despite their lack of experience in ruling and poorer status compared to the alternatives, the Umpquan family was placed in charge of the cities of Oakridge and Bachelor Butte due to their Traditionalist connections. Under their management, these cities experienced radical reorganization according to Regalist principles. Rights were expanded among all members of their populace, but particularly the nobility. Traditionalists from across the Union began to take notice of the Umpquan conviction and held up the state as an ideal example of their religious outlook."
 hazeldell_lumberjacks_umpqua: "Hazeldell Lumberjacks"
 hazeldell_lumberjacks_umpqua_desc: "In the aftermath of the Oregonian Campaign a number of different entrepreneurial individuals founded companies with the sole goal of rebuilding the region. The most popular of these organizations was the Hazeldell Company. The Hazeldells got their start among the poorer generation of Umpquan nobility whose lands were razed by the Redwood invaders. Their mission was noticed by the Traditionalists further south and advocated for in the Union Congress. Rather than giving money directly to the dukes of the new Oregonian states, who the Traditionalists thought were corrupt and secretly controlled by the Sons of Oregon, many Traditionalist dukes advocated for giving funding to companies like the Hazeldells instead."
 bachelors_shadow_umpqua: "Bachelor's Shadow"
 bachelors_shadow_umpqua_desc: "Many within the Umpquan family were promised that they would gain control of the entire Oregonian Cascades rather than the puny territories that we now hold. In an attempt to appease the Trueheirs of the Union, Warmsprings was given independence rather than being subjugated under our reign. This betrayal requires manual correction. Our armies will march in all directions, until all the mountains that lie in Bachelor’s shadow are under our rule."
 willamette_ambitions_umpqua: "Bane of Tyrants"
 willamette_ambitions_umpqua_desc: "Oregon’s lack of progress compared to the rest of the Union comes from the shadowy individuals which seek to oppress its citizenry. This is clear to see, just follow the trail of failure. The crooked elector of Willamette has close ties to the Sons of Oregon and has even considered integrating them into their state’s government. Portland is ruled by a cabal of Naturalists, warped Progressives who have no idea of the Constitution’s contents because they can’t read. Look at Astoria, a nation named after those Judases of Clatsop. Oregon will never be free until their corrupt ilk is purged."
 river_umpqua_umpqua: "River Umpqua"
 river_umpqua_umpqua_desc: "The House of Umpqua gained its name from the Umpqua river which flows across southern Oregon and into the Pacific Sea. The river provides our citizens with fresh water for their families and their crops. Through conquest we hope to one day reunite the entire length of our namesake, but until that day we must ensure that we preserve the river so that future generations may enjoy its beauty."

 dismantle_republican_threat_umpqua_desc: "While the other states of Oregon seem to roll over and accept the presence of malicious actors in their state, we will not sit idly by and let our citizenry be exploited. The Sons of Oregon are terrorists who wish for nothing more but the complete corruption of common decency. We must raid their houses and crush their movement before it begins to corrupt decent folk."
 traditionalist_allies_umpqua_title: "Traditionalist Allies"
 traditionalist_allies_umpqua_desc: "Our nation was created through the actions of key Traditionalist states to our south, it is our duty to repay their kindness in turn. We should make an effort to reach out to their diplomats and secure closer ties to other Traditionalist nations. Hopefully, through enough political finagling, we can earn a place in their communities and the ears of powerful individuals."

 balance_the_scales_umpqua_desc: "While Trueheirs may align themselves with the Traditionalists in most matters of governance, they rarely side with our sort in the Union Congress. In this way, we are alone among our Progressive neighbors in Oregon. To make up for this imbalance we ought to reach for the lofty title of elector. As an elector we can guide Oregon towards a beautiful Regalist future."

 regalist_networking_umpqua_desc: "Traditionalists have never been able to hold the office of the Presidency. Ever since the Union’s founding it has been a Progressive position. Perhaps it is time for a change to this state of affairs. Most of the Traditionalist states have thrown their weight behind the elector from Reno, yet some of our advisors claim that we could have a good shot at the office if we put our mind to it."

 inspire_the_soldiers_umpqua_desc: "Soldiers which are not properly motivated will be ineffective in battle. Our brave defenders have yet to recover from the massacres of the Redwood Campaign. We must bolster their morale and hire the proper talent to guide them into battle."
 united_cascades_umpqua_title: "United Cascades"
 united_cascades_umpqua_desc: "Our nation was originally promised control over all of the Oregonian Cascades. This move was prematurely stopped by the Napan president, who demanded that the northern territories of the Cascades be handed over to Warmsprings. We have never forgotten this misjustice. The Cascades will be made whole under our reign, no matter the cost."
 casting_out_the_savages_umpqua_title: "Casting Out The Savages"
 casting_out_the_savages_umpqua_desc: "Portland has been taken over by a cabal of backward savages. They believe in the total destruction of civilization and a return to the natural world. Even worse, they have twisted The Founder’s words to fulfill this goal and have subsequently corrupted the simple minds of many of their citizens. This horrific goal has only been placated by the states that surround them. We cannot let this continue, the city of Portland must be conquered and restored to its former glory."
 astorian_arrival_umpqua_title: "Astorian Arrival"
 astorian_arrival_umpqua_desc: "Astoria stands as a monument to everything wrong with the Progressive domination of Oregon. The Sons of Oregon should have been destroyed by the occupying Redwoods instead of being left to fester. Rather than removing all of their traitorous stains, the President created a state named after the preeminent family of the Republic. The wife of that brute Quitiquit no doubt holds ties to that horrific organization. We will do what the President was unable to and pull out their roots."

 republican_hotbeds_umpqua_title: "Republican Hotbeds"
 republican_hotbeds_umpqua_desc: "Along the Willamette river, the Sons of Oregon plot to topple the fragile elector’s hold over Oregon. The Progressives of Willamette, just like their president, are weak and ineffectual. There are rumors among some of their government that their duke is considering allowing former members of the Sons of Oregon into the government. Such actions would be disastrous for the security of the region. We must end their rule to prevent us from befalling such a fate."
 conservative_oregon_umpqua_title: "Conservative Oregon"
 conservative_oregon_umpqua_desc: "There are only a few territories in Oregon that now lie outside of our rule. For all intents and purposes we have finally achieved our wondrous goal of liberating Oregon from the corrupt Progressives. We are now tasked with the arduous process of removing their corrupt ideology from the population and claiming the remaining Progressive territories."

 deschutes_dreams_umpqua_title: "Deschutes Dreams"
 deschutes_dreams_umpqua_desc: "The Deschutes river serves a vital purpose in carrying goods between the Oregonian Highdesert and the Inland Empire of Washington and Idaho. Through conquering its flow our nation could assume stewardship over the river and use its bountiful resources to further our conquests in the east."
 imperial_deschutes_umpqua: "Imperial Deschutes"
 oregonian_outskirts_umpqua_title: "Oregonian Outskirts"
 oregonian_outskirts_umpqua_desc: "Morrow and Crook are home to many nobles who have fallen for the lies of the Progressive mechanism. They believe themselves to stand in opposition to our goals, but this cannot be further from the truth. Under our reign they will see the great benefits that come from working hand in hand with the king rather than against him."
 umpqua_events.1.t: "Representation For Oregon"
 umpqua_events.1.d: "A large factor driving the independence of the Oregonian Republic in the first place was a lack of representation for the region. Ever since the dawn of the 11th century, the Oregonians have lobbied continuously for the creation of an Oregonian electorate. Their attempts were repeatedly rebuffed by the Franciscan president at the behest of the traditionally more influential Washingtonians in the north. It was only with the region’s total revolt during The War of The Mad and the brutal Redwood Campaign that this changed. Willamette and the Duck family were a poor choice for this position. Their house is completely uncritical of the President’s actions and continuously supports their poor decisions. This sort of yes manning has no place in a Union which is actively struggling with remaining competitive with the rest of the continent. Despite this, their representation was better than the current state of affairs. As it stands Oregon has been left without a single seat in the Electoral Congress. We must do something to ensure that our region is not left behind in Union politics. As the foremost power in the region, we would no doubt serve as the perfect vessel for this new electorate. A well written letter to the President will hopefully see this issue resolved in the proper manner."
 umpqua_events.1.a: "Its In The President's Hands Now"
 three_options_pres_gives_prez_removes_rand_prez_doesnt_and_gets: "The President of the §YUOC§! will have the opportunity to remove the electorship from one of the current electors and grant it to us. If the President dismisses our request they will gain:"
 umpqua_events.2.t: "Oregonian Traditionalists"
 umpqua_events.2.d: "Oregon has lost its representation in the Electoral College, a fact which has troubled at least one duke of the region. The ruler of Umpqua has decided that they are fed up with their lack of say. They have sent a letter to [Root.Captial.GetName] demanding that we give them the electorate. This flagrant display of power hungry behavior is no doubt a grave insult to our rule, yet we have been placed in a difficult situation in deciding our response. If we reject their request, the Umpquans will no doubt turn around and make a big stink about their lack of representation. Just the same, accepting their request will no doubt make one of the electors angry as we would need to take their status. We must carefully consider our next moves to ensure that our successors can hold on to the Presidential office."

 umpqua_events.2.i: "There are more pressing matters."
 umpqua_events.3.t: "Presidential Betrayl"
 umpqua_events.3.d: "We have just received news from the President that our title of elector will be removed. This is a grave injustice against our house and will be met with the strongest retribution. Apparently this move was made in an attempt to appease the Oregonians. The region has long served as a thorn in the Union’s side and the President’s actions continues to prove that their sort has no place at the Californian table."
 umpqua_events.3.a: "They will pay!"
 umpqua_events.4.t: "Ambitions Spurrned"
 umpqua_events.4.d: "The President has denied our request for electorship. While we half expected them to do this, their response is nonetheless disappointing. Many members of the royal family are incensed at this action and have begun telling other Traditionalists. Hopefully the pressure from other dukes will sway the President to change their mind."
 umpqua_events.4.a: "They will pay!"
 umpqua_events.5.t: "Guiding Oregon"
 umpqua_events.5.d: "In a stroke of luck, the President has decided to grant our state the electorship we desired. While we half expected them to reject our offer outright, we knew in our hearts that this would be the outcome. The President has lost much of their political influence in recent years, another bad mark on their record could have been the straw that broke the camel’s back."
 umpqua_events.5.a: "Wonderful!"
 umpqua_events.6.t: "That Sublime Office"
 umpqua_events.6.d: "While it is well known that absolute power corrupts absolutely, it is worthwhile to note that even small amounts of power can lead to complete corruption as well. For centuries us Traditionalists have pursued the white whale of the Presidency. At every step a Progressive has managed to steal that prize from our representatives. We live in an age where the promise of a Traditionalist presidency is more likely than ever before, yet the current people’s choice is less than perfect. The Elector of Reno has historically been part of the old guard network of Nevada. The new Union needs someone fresh, not yet another bureaucrat from a long line of power. As the other Traditionalist power in the Union, we are expected to support the Reonians on the basis of our alliance, but what if we didn’t?"
 umpqua_events.6.a: "Stay in our lane."
 umpqua_events.6.b: "Challenge Reno."
 umpqua_events.6.c: "Take on Reno's legacy."
