 the_mighty_paiute_burns: "The Mighty Paiute"
 the_mighty_paiute_burns_desc: "For centuries our people have been relied upon by the warmongers of the empire to staff their front lines. In the past we were ruled over by the influential duke of Highdesert. During those times we were required to send a portion of our young men to die in the duke’s wars. Among their cowardly citizenry we developed a reputation for bravery and excellence in combat. This led the generals to call for more soldiers of our kin. As generations passed, members of the lower bands slowly began to train their young ones to become soldiers. Our society is now home to a vast warrior class, expertly trained and ready for conflict."
 numu_burns: "Numu"
 numu_burns_desc: "Language is complicated among Trueheir societies. While they are now known for their use of Sahaptain, in ancient times each band had an almost unrecognizable personal tongue which they used for communication between members of the band. The large size of the Paiute Wadadökadö band led to a wide proliferation of their native language of Numu. Numu served a vital role in the Utahn campaign during The War of the Mad, where underground Paiute diplomats used the language to hide communication to the resistance in occupied territories."
 dreams_of_unity_burns: "Dreams Of Unity"
 dreams_of_unity_burns_desc: "Calls for unity among the Trueheir nations of the Union have not been uncommon, but more often than not are unsuccessful due to competing tribal interests. The inevitable state of such a union would come in the form of a Confederacy, yet most Chairmen are unwilling to give up their influence and become a lesser part in a united state. Moving into the 15th and 16th centuries, the Confederacy of Burns led most calls for Trueheir unity. Though coalitions were formed and preparations were made, their dream never materialized into reality."
 tubodu_works_burns: "Tubodu Works"
 tubodu_works_burns_desc: "Among the most celebrated works of the Classical era were those of the Tobodu. Starting out as a small collective of Paiute Classicalist writers, their ranks soon grew into a massive guild of Trueheir artists. The favorite topic of this group was the recent War of The Mad. Extensive histories and stories of the heroic Redwood crusaders, dastardly Republicans, and the eventual triumph of the Napan President gripped readers of the Union and cast a new light on what was historically seen as a tragic event."
 highdesert_wrangling_burns: "Highdesert Wrangling"
 highdesert_wrangling_burns_desc: "The Highdesert is a large desolate region of Oregon which is bounded between the Cascades and Blue Oregon. Life among its vast plains is brutal, but through generations of wisdom the High Oregonians have found a way to make a living despite the circumstances. The Wranglers are a special group of nomads who live in the Highdesert and follow their herds across its length. In times of war, they can be relied upon to fiercely defend the lands from all invading forces."
 protecting_our_heritage_burns: "Protecting Our Heritage"
 protecting_our_heritage_burns_desc: "While our homeland was spared invasion during The War of The Mad, many elders still fear that the new President is too weak to defend our people. We must take these matters into our own hands. Call all of our sons home and press them into the defense of the capital. We will fight to our last breath in defense of our way of life."
 trueheir_representation_burns: "Trueheir Representation"
 trueheir_representation_burns_desc: "Given the number of different groups and cultures in the Union and the limited number of seats in the electoral college, it is inevitable that some groups will eventually be left out. Ever since the Union’s foundation, the Trueheirs have attempted to garner a seat at the table. Time and time again we have been snubbed so that the Nevadans, Oregonians, and Washingotnians can get a word in. We cannot let this injustice continue to stand. We will get representation. If that means that we challenge the President himself, then so be it."

 strike_at_the_snakes_burns_title: "Strike At The Snakes"
 strike_at_the_snakes_burns_desc: "Dozens of cowardly families fled through our borders to the north during The War of the Mad. Each one that rapped at our door demanded that we provide them shelter and protection. We did so, but at a hefty price. Resources were scarce and their expensive tastes cost us dearly. Despite our gracious acceptance of their sort, many of those rich bastards still hold a grudge against our actions. They now greedily eye up our gold resources at Canyon City. Let us demonstrate proper manners to them."
 reach_the_columbia_burns_title: "Reach The Columbia"
 reach_the_columbia_burns_desc: "The Columbia river breathes life into the Northwest. Her tributaries connect Theanites, Collectivists, and Partisans in mutual need for commerce. Controlling key ports along its length will greatly increase our trade influence within the region. The obvious next step in our expansion should be to stretch our borders to the Columbia and secure a foothold in the Inland Empire trade."

 crooked_conquest_burns_title: "Crooked Conquest"
 crooked_conquest_burns_desc: "The land of Morrow and Crook are similar to those of the Echoites in their makeup. Their territories are made up of primarily rich nobles. The two states are mired in a mess of conflict due to the actions of the local Sons of Oregon. Now would be the perfect time to strike due to their current occupation with the domestic threat."
 defensive_forces_burns_title: "Defensive Forces"
 defensive_forces_burns_desc: "It should be our state’s primary intention to not build a force for expansion, but rather one for the defense of our people. For centuries, the Californians have attempted to restrain our growth and crush our traditions. Such was the fate of the Monos in Nevada and the peoples of the South Bay. We will not fall into the darkness of assimilation. Our soldiers will defend the Paiute way of life to their final breaths."
 consolidate_the_highdesert_burns_title: "Consolidate The Highdesert"
 consolidate_the_highdesert_burns_desc: "To the untrained eye, the Oregonian Highdesert may look like a worthless stretch of scorching hot plains, but we see its true potential. The untapped landscape would be perfect for development and expansion, all it needs is a little guidance. Whatever remains out of our reach must be conquered by force or taken diplomatically through negotiations with our fellow Trueheirs."

 greeting_the_utahns_burns_title: "Greeting The Utahns"
 greeting_the_utahns_burns_desc: "The Utahns fester in the lands of Orria and Galicia like a plague. In ancient times, their ilk would have been dealt with by the strong Francisco Presidency. Unfortunately, the current President is much less capable of going toe to toe with such a giant. It is up to us to ensure that the Union remains whole."

 deschutes_domination_burns_title: "Deschutes Domination"
 deschutes_domination_burns_desc: "While we are uninterested in getting involved in all the messy affairs of the Oregonians, there still remains one part of their region that is of interest to us. The Deschutes river is an important connector between the Jeffersonians in the south and the Columbian trade. Traders at the mouth of the river, in The Dalles, have routinely undercut our own merchants due to their favorable deals established with the Jeffersonains. If we were to add them under our rule, we would gain access to their connections and remove this final barrier to our domination of the Northwest market."
 downstream_influence_burns: "Downstream Influence"
 a_real_inland_empire_burns_title: "A Real Inland Empire"
 a_real_inland_empire_burns_desc: "Though not as illustrious as the Cascadian trade further west, commerce in the Inland Empire has the potential to make whichever nation controls its whims unimaginably powerful. We have wrangled many of the Columbia river’s tributaries under our control, now it is time to invest in their ports to hold complete control over inland commerce. When all is said and done, we will hold the strings to the west and finally stand as an economic powerhouse."

 religious_aptitude_burns_title: "Religious Aptitude"
 religious_aptitude_burns_desc: "Like most Trueheir states, our confederacy tends to stay neutral in matters of faith and Union politics. We align ourselves most closely with the Traditionalists, yet have never made an effort to join the Nevadan network of influence. Some in our state believe that this should change. They reckon that in this new age of instability, it is wise to side with the folks that have all the power. While we understand their perspective, we must follow the advice of the Spirit of Liberty above all. Let us call upon its wisdom before we make any rash decisions."

 industrious_expansion_burns_desc: "Few have attempted to tame the Highdesert and even fewer have seen any sort of success. Prosperity comes from greater development. Luckily for us, we live in an age of great technological change and advancement. The new institutions of the day will greatly serve our interests in attracting attention to our homeland and ensuring that our citizens share in our state’s prosperity."

 paiute_tribes_burns_title: "Paiute Tribes"
 paiute_tribes_burns_desc: "Unlike the Californians, our state is one governed in large part by the will of our citizens. A Trueheir Confederacy is a unified collection of different bands, or tribes, each of which is led by a chieftan. The chieftains hold vast influence over their state and select one of their own to govern all the bands as a Chairman. We must put our faith in the Chairman to represent our interests and assist them in uniting the disparate bands."
 trueheir_networking_burns_title: "Trueheir Networking"
 trueheir_networking_burns_desc: "There are many across the Union who share a similar history to ours. Every day that passes, more of our brethren lose their traditions to the influence of the brutal Californians. If we wish to survive this next century, we will need to band together. Reach out to the other chieftains and form a defensive alliance. Side by side, we will make our voice heard."

 the_mighty_ducks_burns_desc: "To our south, the Shopai of Duck Valley have valiantly stood watch and resisted Utahn influence. For too long they have done this task alone. The President has abandoned them. The Traditionalists have abandoned them. If we didn’t know better, we would say The Founder had abandoned them. Someone should go forward and relieve them of their post. With our combined might, perhaps those brave souls can finally rest."

 the_numu_path_burns_desc: "The Yakamans in the north, arrogant and warlike, have attempted to bring together the Trueheirs of this Union under their hostile creed. Our future does not lie in contention with the Californians, but living alongside them. We must make an effort to be seen by the other electors. A single vote should do the trick. That will show the other Chairmen that our nation can serve as a proper representative of Trueheir unity."

 multicultured_state_burns_title: "Multicultured State"
 multicultured_state_burns_desc: "While our capital is primarily inhabited by Trueheirs, all the lands that lie beyond Burns are inhabited by the hardy High Oregonians. Their sort have been kind to our rule which has made the fact that we have not embraced them in earnest even more painful. Most High Oregonians are still treated as second class citizens, prevented from serving in office or even raising issues at meetings with the Chairman. Let us right this injustice and finally give the High Oregonians a seat at the table."

 fate_of_the_oregonians_burns_title: "Fate of The Oregonians"
 fate_of_the_oregonians_burns_desc: "Through our expansion and acceptance of the High Oregoniains, we have slowly come to the horrifying conclusion that we are outnumbered. There are far more of their sort than there are Trueheirs in our state. This has made several facts of our rule quite awkward. While some of the High Oregonians have tried to integrate into tribes, others have founded their own in an attempt to gain representation. Many of the elders fear that if this continues, we may soon face revolt or an erasure of our traditions."
 provs_with_oregonian_burns: "Provinces with §YHigh Oregonian§! culture owned by §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
 golden_opportunity_burns_title: "Golden Opportunity"
 golden_opportunity_burns_desc: "One of the most coveted parts of our state lies at Canyon City. The city’s historic gold mines keep our Confederacy’s coffers full through lean times. Their production is so enviable that the Echoites in our north have attempted to send settlers over to the province to claim it for their own. Now that we have secured our independence in the Union, we can work on ensuring that the mines of Canyon City can continue to enrich our people for generations."
 burns_events.1.t: "Neutrality's Burden"
 burns_events.1.d: "Trueheir nations routinely serve as a neutral part in Union politics, particularly party squabbles. Of course, our representatives attempt to argue for Trueheir interests, but we have found that getting bogged down in the arguments of Traditionalists or Progressives is unproductive. Despite this, some of the elders within our Confederacy have begun to argue for getting more involved. They claim that we might need the influence of the Traditionalists in the future. Ever since the end of the war, their lot have consistently tried to rope our representatives into their political schemes. Their party holds complete control of the Union Congress. With our help they may flip even more Chairmen and obtain a super majority. The question ahead of us asks if such a favor would be worth it in the long haul. "
 burns_events.1.a: "The Traditionalists have our back."

 burns_events.2.t: "Valley Authority"
 burns_events.2.d: "Ever since we began our alliance with Duck Valley, there have been whispers of a union between our two Confederacies. This type of merger is not uncommon among Trueheir nations, but has become less favored as more of the Chairmen attempt to hold on to their power. [Root.Monarch.GetName] holds no such qualms and has publicly expressed interest in merging together our Paiute bands. In the end, it will be up to the bands of Duck Valley to decide if they wish to become part of something greater. For so long they have stood against the Utahn threat alone. Perhaps if we were by their side, such a task would become much easier. Let us send our representatives to make our intentions clear and gauge their response."

 burns_events.3.t: "A Trueheir Union"
 burns_events.3.d: "A messenger from [From.GetName] has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] expressing their Chairman’s desire to unify our two Confederacies. Though we come from the same Paiute stock, our nations are extremely different in the makeup of our various bands. We share little family connections with their sort and only a handful of traditions. Yet, some among our state have argued that this union may be for the best. With our combined resources  we could more effectively resist a Utahn invasion and even possibly unite Orria. We must carefully consider how we word our response lest we anger our close ally."
 burns_events.3.a: "We have to accept!"
 burns_events.3.b: "We will not become the Wadadökadö's lapdogs."
 burns_events.4.t: "Our New Partners"
 burns_events.4.d: "We have just received word back from [From.GetName]. Shockingly, they have shown complete support towards the prospect of a greater Confederacy. Let us reach out to their elders and begin the process of dividing up the lands at once. When all is said and done, the Union will be stronger with our combined might!"
 burns_events.4.a: "Welcome to the family."
 burns_events.5.t: "Some Bad News"
 burns_events.5.d: "We have just received word back from [From.GetName]. In a strongly worded letter, their Chairman has decided that our ambitious merger would lead to the death of their band. [From.GetSheHe] strongly condemned our implications and waived away all the great benefits that would come from unity. It seems that their sort will not be able to listen to reason. We may need to take the task of unifying the Paiutes into our own hands."
 burns_events.5.a: "They will pay."
 burns_events.6.t: "Madukanna"
 burns_events.6.d: "The Wadadökadö face a choice like no other we have made before. For so long we have been relegated to be second class citizens to the Californians, a fate so terrible we would wish it on no others, yet it seems that through the expansion of our state we have come to treat the High Oregonians as they once treated us. To circumvent this lesser status within our confederacy, several of the Oregonians have begun adopting some of our traditions and forming their own tribes. They call themselves the “Madukanna,” a Numu word we generally use to refer to the Californians. While this by itself would not amount to much, our problems emerged when our own band members began to embrace this new type of identity for themselves. Among some of the younger generation it is getting much harder to tell who is actually Paitue and whose family is Oregonian. This has led to a widespread debate among the elders as to our next step. Some suggest we adopt this new identity for the entire Confederacy and use it to unite the people. Others have said that we cannot give up our own identities and should ban any member of their tribe from taking part in the confederation. Finally, there is even a small faction which believes that we should give up power and let the Oregonians take over. They claim that a peaceful transfer would ensure our autonomy within the new Highdesert state. For the sake of future generations, we must seriously consider which of these options ensures the best outcome for the survival of the Paitues."
