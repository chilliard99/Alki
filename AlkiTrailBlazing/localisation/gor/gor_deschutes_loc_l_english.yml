 river_rivals_deschutes: "River Rivals"
 river_rivals_deschutes_desc: "The Deschutes is not just another tribute of the Columbia, it is a vital connection between the lands of Jefferson and Washington. The recent War of The Mad has utterly destroyed the cities along the Willamette and paved the way for our own territories to take their place. Through careful trading and commercial investments, we may come to soon dominate the entire Cascadian market. Hand and hand, burghers and nobles alike will make us rich!"
 plentiful_irrigation_deschutes: "Plentiful Irrigation"
 plentiful_irrigation_deschutes_desc: "Our home river provides plenty of irrigation for our farmers and water for our citizens. This has granted us distinct advantages compared to our Highdesert neighbors as we can produce more than enough food to supply our population. As the cities of Bend and Lakeview continue to grow, we will only rely more on The Founder’s natural blessings."
 woodworkers_fury_deschutes: "Woodworker's Fury"
 woodworkers_fury_deschutes_desc: "The largest city along the Deschutes, Bend, is best known for its logging industry. In peacetime, most soldiers hang up their swords and armor to live humble lives in the forests. This has greatly benefited our state, as the ability for retirement allows soldiers to grow greater ties with their local areas. A true appreciation has appeared among the woodworkers, many of which would be ready to lay down their lives in defense of our glorious kingdom."
 duke_of_lakeview_deschutes: "Duke Of Lakeview"
 duke_of_lakeview_deschutes_desc: "Throughout the 15th century, the Duke of Lakeview came to take on a guiding role for the lands of East Oregon and parts of Jefferson. Members of his influential Crook family were soon placed on the throne of nearly every East Oregonian state. Many further south in Nevada and Liberty jokingly called the area “Crookia,” but we have attempted to avoid the spread of such a moniker. We are thankful for our connection to the Crooks and hope to rely upon their support in the years to come."
 three_starred_flag_deschutes: "Three Starred Flag"
 three_starred_flag_deschutes_desc: "Deschutes is a nation founded on the fundamental premise that Jeffersonians, Oregonians, and High Oregonians can live side by side under a single flag. As a representation of this premise, our flag features three stars. The Blue Star represents the Jeffersonians whose citizens have bravely resisted the rule of the Redwoods. The Green Star represents the Oregonians and the luscious forests that line the Willamette. The Yellow Star represents the High Oregonians, whose home in the Highdesert is arid and hot as the Sun itself."
 union_outcasts_deschutes: "Union Outcasts"
 union_outcasts_deschutes_desc: "The Jeffersonians, Oregonians, and High Oregonians are the most ignored of all the Californains. It took a revolt along the Willamette and an extremely bloody war with the President themselves to even get the electorate for the Oregonians. The Washingtonians in the north and the southerners have always tried to cast our lot to the sidelines. We will no longer be ignored. Our combined might and diplomatic influence will force them to add another chair to their table."
 coralling_the_wilds_deschutes: "Coralling The Wilds"
 coralling_the_wilds_deschutes_desc: "Compared to the rich lands of the Willamette, most of the lands inhabited by our Jeffersonian and Oregonian citizens are sparse and without much development. The Highdesert is inhospitable and the mountains of Klamath and the lower Cascades are difficult to navigate. Though the task might seem impossible, it must be our nation’s focus to elevate these farther flung regions to ensure that all three of our stars sit on an equal footing."

We beseech them to ignore the ploys of Presidents and the argumentative counts of the south and instead focus on unity. Despite our differences we can all come together under a single banner. We meet them with a promise of a single nation, a three starred kingdom, a state with three equal peoples centered around the Deschutes. It is now our duty to ensure that this does not remain just a promise."

The Three Star Kingdom places the success of these three groups above others and attempts to treat all of them as equals under the same banner."
 factional_power: "Factional Power"
 factional_power_desc: "Factional power represents the influence of Preservists and Nationalists within our state. Low factional power represents an increase in the control of the Preservists who wish to see the Jeffersonians, Oregonians, and High Oregonians maintain their cultural identities. High factional power represents the Nationalists who wish to unite each of these groups under a single national identity and remove the old cultural ones.\n\nFactional power is increased by:\n-Winning Wars (§Y+5§!)\n-Converting provinces to a culture other than Jeffersonian, Oregonian, or High Oregonian (§Y+1§!)\n-Hiring Administrative Advisors(§Y+1§!)\n\nFactional power is decreased by:\n-Promoting Cultures (§Y-20§!)\n-Converting provinces to Jeffersonian, Oregonian, or High Oregonian (§Y-1§!)\n-Hiring Diplomatic Advisors(§Y-1§!)\n\nAt §Y100§!

 breach_the_southern_gate_deschutes_desc: "The Great Redwood gate stands tall as a mockery to the unity of Jefferson. For too long their king has oppressed ours. When they marched into the capitals of Oregon and burnt them to the ground they showed us no mercy. When they sought to make the Jeffersonians into a slave class in their so-called “Republic” they showed us no mercy. Why should we extend the courtesy to them? Raze it. Raze it to the foundations."

We must rush ahead to take over these territories before any conflicts emerge with the locals."

 three_star_hub_deschutes_desc: "To expand our nation’s power diplomatically we can make use of the Deschutes’s connection to the Columbia river and attempt to corral the Cascadian and Inland Empire markets. Control of these valuable trades will give us the ducats we need to fund our armies and begin the beautification of the farther flung territories of our kingdom. The quickest way to accomplish this aim would be through the development of key trading cities. Let us choose an important place with room to grow and turn it into a market the rest of California can envy!"

Claiming important Columbian centers of trade and creating a river fleet would go a long way in securing our control over these valuable routes. Domination of this market will determine whether our state will grow into the economic powerhouse we have dreamed of."

While the traders of the east must carry their goods across long distances inland, we can simply build small river vessels and travel to the coast. In order to realize this ambition we must construct a fleet of sufficient size and quality that each ship can patrol both the waters of the Pacific and the Columbia."
 a_dissapointing_sight_deschutes_title: "Disappointing Sight"
 a_dissapointing_sight_deschutes_desc: "The mouth of the Columbia river is home to some of the most dangerous waters on the continent. In the past, our sailors relied upon the guidance of the Ol’ Disappointment to guide them home. The Redwoods were not kind to the structure and tore it down to prevent any Oregonian vessels from rushing down the Columbia to defend Portland. The river’s exit is now full of the corpses of long dead vessels from centuries past. They serve as a constant reminder of the danger of life on the sea. We live in an age of great nautical advancement, there is no need for all this destruction. Gather the builders and tell them to restore that great lighthouse, no longer will we fall prey to the dangers of the Colubmia."

 chase_the_cascades_deschutes_desc: "The Cascades are a vast mountain range which stretches all the way from Jefferson into the north. In ancient times they served as the northern border of Libertarian civilization. Those south of the mountains were enlightened and those to the north were seen as savages. With the direction this Union has taken within recent years, it is hard to say that this is not still the case. Let us show those pompous Redwoods and Libertarians what us “savages” are capable of."

In ancient times they bartered with the Californians, some of which began to settle along the coast of their region. Over time these Jeffersonians generally integrated into Californian society, always seen as below the coastal Californians who soon became known as “Redwoods.” It is finally time that the Jeffersonians rise to take their rightful place as the rulers of their namesake."

There have been many suggestions by advisors from all corners of our nation. The Oregonians, of both high and western variety, see them as traitors in need of extermination and exile. They believe that should the Snakes come under our rule we will turn into an aristocratic society. Alternatively, the Jeffersonians have begun to suggest that we embrace them as brothers and add another star to our flag. The Jeffersonians have posited that we can use their wealth in order to further liberate our brethren across the Union. Whatever our choice, let us ensure that The Founder’s chosen people come out on top rather than any avarice prone slobs."

The Jeffersonians and Oregonians call for the complete eradication and exile of the Redwoods and are threatening to form a coalition should we not give into their request. The High Oregonians speak for the nationalists in saying that we should add another star to our flag to represent the Redwoods.

They see no difference in us and the oppressor which has caused significant strife between our two groups. Now that we have conquered the Pomo we finally have an opportunity to definitely rule on how we wish to deal with their lot. The Pomo share close trading ties to the families of the South Bay, connections we wish to exploit. We see two ways of doing this. First, we could force their conversion to one of our Three Star peoples and take the connections by force. This way would likely provoke outrage from their sort and cause a loss of trust in the long run. Alternatively we could allow them to continue to keep their identity and let them be. This would go against our goal of promoting the prosperity of our peoples above all others, but would likely generate influence for our nation among the South Bay families. We must now decide if this compromise is worth it."

We then transitioned into a role as a transjeffersonian state which meant to unite the looked over people of the Californias. This seemingly impossible task has finally been completed with our conquests of the remainder of Oregon and parts of Jefferson. Our people must now decide where to go next. There are two paths forward. First, we can work towards inward perfection with the development of the lands along the Columbia’s tributaries. Alternatively we can attempt to continue our conquests of the Californias and attempt to unite all of The Founder’s people under our three starred banner. Before we make such a difficult decision, let us consult with the princes and the people, it is through their will that we have gotten this far."
