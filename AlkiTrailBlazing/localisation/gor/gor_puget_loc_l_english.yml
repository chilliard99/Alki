 barony_reform_desc: "A form of monarchy where the ruler is the largest landowner of the state. Baronies were a common style of government in the early Union where influence in Congress could be bought through favor and coin.

 puget_defend_the_sound_desc: "The Puget Sound is part of the wider Salish sea which surrounds our home here in Washington. Inside of Puget’s gentle embrace, our ancestors built all that lies here today. There are many unscrupulous individuals who wish to see all of our glorious cities sacked and burned to the ground. It is our duty, just as it was the duty of those that came before us, to defend these brave lands from those individuals."
 puget_baronic_ambition: "Baronic Ambition"
 puget_baronic_ambition_desc: "Barony has become a kind of naughty term throughout the Union. In ages past, before the Franciscan president had expanded their iron grip over most of this land, it was common for the title of count to be fluid. It would often be passed around by whoever was the wealthiest individual in the state, that is whoever had enough money to outbribe their competitors. The most successful of the Union Baronies was the Barony of Puget led by the Dach family. Their control of the Siren League made the Dachs richer than most foreign kings."
 puget_industrial_heartland: "Industrial Heartland"
 puget_industrial_heartland_desc: "Washington can be split into two regions: Puget and Lincoln. The eastern Lincolnites are primarily agrarian, with exceptions in the industrial centers of Spokane and Colville. On the other hand the Pugetites are primarily craftsmen and traders. This historic culture of artisanry has allowed our nation to punch far above its weight economically."
 puget_cascadian_birthplace: "Cascadian Birthplace"
 puget_cascadian_birthplace_desc: "When the Union fell to the influence of Anarchists and Despots, when Oregon finally achieved its freedom and broke away, Washington was left alone and without direction. The scars of Collectivist organization instilled a sense of rebellion into its people. A spirit of separation emerged among the Washingtonians. No longer would they stand beside the troublesome Californians, nor would they align themselves with the Reds of the north. They would stand alone, as one people united under one banner: Cascadia."

 puget_land_reclamation: "Land Reclamation"
 puget_land_reclamation_desc: "Under the leadership of the Tacomans during the late 15th century, much of the South Basin was drained via the construction of large dikes to provide farmland for the local area. Subsequent attempts to drain lands along the Puget Sound have resulted in the creation of fertile territory which was often used to grow tulips similar to the ones of the Snohomish."
 puget_northern_classicalism: "Northern Classicalism"
 puget_northern_classicalism_desc: "While the Libertarians of the south were deeply concerned with reviving the rationality of their ancient university culture and studying the human form, the Northern Classicalism movement of Washington deepened the connection of its followers to the natural world. The stunning beauty of the pacific northwest served as inspiration for the works of Northern Classical artists, especially the painter Kevin Gleichner whose murals of the Hoh Rainforest litter the governmental buildings of Seattle."

 puget_events.1.t: "Reviving The Barons"
 puget_events.1.d: "The President has not always held sway over the lands of California. First it was the American emperor, who then lost control of the region to its local lord. The subsequent Californian Kingdom was a derisive place kept in line by a series of tyrannical kings. When the kingdom conquered the north, they gave control of Washington to a collection of ambitious lords. They transformed the lands along Puget sound into an important mercantile center for Pacific trade. The merchant guilds born out of this expansion soon came to rival the power of the local lords. Many banded together to form a united cartel known as the Siren League. Over the following centuries, a family known as the Dachs slowly intermarried their way into gaining land along the Puget sound and a controlling share of the Siren League. Alongside the lords of Joaquin, Toiyabe, and the brother of the King they overthrew the Californian Kingdom and ushered in a new age of democracy. The birth of the Union of California favored those lords which originally created it. Its early years were dominated by the corrupting influence of wealthy lords who each paid their way into the presidential office. The most prominent of these barons was the grand patriarch of the Dach family: Casimir Dach. This “Age of Barons” is looked back upon with scorn by many modern counts. They believe themselves to be above the type of political maneuvers practiced by the old Dachs. While we are burdened with their social hangups, perhaps a return to Barony would be for the best in these uncertain times."
