 legacy_of_the_revolution_republic_of_oregon: "Legacy Of The Revolution"
 legacy_of_the_revolution_republic_of_oregon_desc: "For many years we feared that the dream of the Oregonian Republic had died, snuffed out by the very people that were meant to protect it. Yet through the hard work of dedicated patriots, we now see that thought dead dream become a reality. We must never forget their sacrifices and those who lost their lives in the defense of the first republic. May this Second Republic stand for centuries to come. Alis Volat Propriis!"
 national_representation_republic_of_oregon: "National Representation"
 national_representation_republic_of_oregon_desc: "We have found it much easier to give those we have recently conquered a seat at the table rather than letting them fester in rebellious autonomy. Allowing new additions to the Republic to participate in the process of governance more quickly brings them into the fold. While there will always be some who are resistant to our rule, there will be doubly as many formerly disenfranchised folks who will quickly turn to lifelong Republicans."
 oregonian_patchwork_republic_of_oregon: "Oregonian Patchwork"
 oregonian_patchwork_republic_of_oregon_desc: "The word “Oregon” has caused much trouble for some in our state. They believe that the term refers to the Oregonians of the Willamette and Deschutes. This could not be further from the truth. Our revolutionary forefathers, those that founded the First Republic, exposed the Californian lie. We are not one united people, but instead Californians and Oregons. We Oregons have existed since a time before man’s rise to civility. Our identity was stolen from us from the oppressors of the south. Oregon stretches across the entire northwest, from Pocatello to Seattle. We will not rest until all Oregonians are made aware of their true identity and come to embrace it in earnest."
 liberator_of_the_west_republic_of_oregon: "Liberator Of The West"
 liberator_of_the_west_republic_of_oregon_desc: "So much of this continent lies under the thumb of tyrants and despots. The President claims to be above such things yet is just as bad as the rest of them. What America needs is a nation with enough courage and conviction to carry out The Founder’s will. All will fall under the gaze of the Spirit of Liberty and be freed from the power hungry grip of man. Only then, once every man, woman, and child is liberated, can we truly begin to enjoy The Founder’s creation in full."
 egalitarian_taxation_republic_of_oregon: "Egalitarian Taxation"
 egalitarian_taxation_republic_of_oregon_desc: "In more corrupt nations, your status in society would determine your burden of tax. Under The Second Republic, this will not be the case. All manner of nobles and paupers will pay their fair share. While this will certainly lead some richer individuals to flee for other states where they can hoard their wealth, the wise among them will recognize the prosperity that can be had through cooperation with our administration. Together, all of us will grow fat and lazy. By the end, we will never have to worry about wealth again."
 land_of_scholars_republic_of_oregon: "Land Of Scholars"
 land_of_scholars_republic_of_oregon_desc: "The most important of The Founder’s gifts to mankind is his own mind. Without the ability to think, to reason, we are left without direction in this chaotic world. We must train every Republican to rely upon their own wits. When the world comes battering at their walls and demanding to fill their ears with conspiratorial ideologies, they will have a robust bulwark to protect their pure souls from corruption."
 columbian_commerce_republic_of_oregon: "Columbian Commerce"
 columbian_commerce_republic_of_oregon_desc: "No river in California can rival the glory of the Columbia. Its outstretched tributaries connect our citizens to those as far as Idaho. In the wrong hands, it can be used to control the lives of thousands of people. Under our rule it will be used to elevate common trade. We will reach out far and wide to make prosperous deals with those upstream in an attempt to ensure our coffers stay full till kingdom come."

 cutting_edge_northwest_republic_desc: "Our nation prides itself on remaining at the forefront of weapons technology. The enemy soldiers we face in war fight with sticks and stones, charging head on into the rapid fire of our automatic weapons. The smartest of our scientists spend day after day investigating the most proficient weapons of war so that our sons and daughters are properly equipped against any foe they face on the battlefield."
 citizen_governance_northwest_republic: "Citizen Governance"
 citizen_governance_northwest_republic_desc: "Rather than letting the affairs of the state be decided by any king or unaccountable bureaucrat, we leave most levers of governace in the hands of the common citizen. Citizens elect among their own to fill positions in the state. This ensures that no angered group is left without an outlet for their rage. With the ability to remove those who are inefficient from their positions and put someone better in their place there is no need for domestic unrest or rebellion."
 glory_of_the_columbia_northwest_republic: "Glory Of The Columbia"
 glory_of_the_columbia_northwest_republic_desc: "The Columbia river has provided our people with opportunities ever since the foundation of our republic in ages past. Along its steady flow the merchant and artisan are united in production and exchange. Any citizen can buy or rent a small barge and ferry their goods up or down its length. The river must never fall into the hands of any greedy government, it is a gift from The Almighty. As long as we rule, the Columbia will remain a free and public resource for anyone to use as they wish."
 pacifying_the_pacific_northwest_republic: "Pacifying The Pacific"
 pacifying_the_pacific_northwest_republic_desc: "Not everyone is open to the promise of Republicanism. Some believe the common citizen to be too ignorant of the complexities of governance. Others believe that the gentler among the population will not have the necessary stomach for war. Through an inevitable result of our conquest, these naysayers will end up becoming part of our state. It will be our great challenge to ensure that they are properly pacified and brought over to our point of view."
 eastern_contacts_northwest_republic: "Eastern Contacts"
 eastern_contacts_northwest_republic_desc: "In a world full of Monarchists, it is nice to know that there are some that share our bend towards Republicanism out east. The Republics of the Atlantic have routinely reached out to our nation and offered their support in defense against the horde of tyrants. As tensions continue to rise between the liberated and enslaved, we must ensure that the Republicans are ready for whenever war comes."
 rule_of_law_northwest_republic: "Rule Of Law"
 rule_of_law_northwest_republic_desc: "No matter what your status, in our Republic all are made to live under the same laws. The President is held to the same restraints as the common citizen. This system ensures that no one individual can subvert the fabric of our Republic and attempt to exert their will over the population without majority support. These institutions make our Republic strong and inspire fear in all those who wish to see us put in chains."
 students_of_enlightenment_northwest_republic: "Students Of The Enlightenment"
 students_of_enlightenment_northwest_republic_desc: "The Enlightenment only reinforced the values of our republic. Our citizens learned many great things from its new philosophies. We gained a deeper respect for the investigation of the natural world and an understanding of The Founder’s limitations. Now our academics focus on gaining more detailed insights into the mechanisms behind life. The secrets of physics, chemistry, and mathematics will guide our state to prosperity."

 restore_republic_of_oregon_nation_desc: "§YAlis Volat Propriis!§!\n\nAmong the citizens of Oregon there is a yearning. A dream only remembered during nights of scant rest. A wish for something greater. Something their forefathers fought and died for. Something stolen away by the President on high and locked away in a great vault. A United Oregon, one not ruled over by some Progressive puppet or shadowy traditionalist, but a truly free Oregon. It is our task to grasp this dream and yank it from the realm of imagination into reality."
 unite_northwest_republic_nation_title: "Unite Northwest Republic"
 unite_northwest_republic_nation_desc: "§YLet Knowledge Serve The Oregons§!\n\nThe Oregons are a region too long divided. In ancient times we recognized the differences between us and the Californias, yet it seems that many have forgotten these divisions. We must bring our brothers in these distant lands under the banner of the Republic, so that they may remember all that was lost in their transformation."

The limitations of their vision have exposed themselves as we have spread our borders to Washington and Jefferson. Luckily, the policymakers of our state have come up with their own solutions to this nagging issue. Breaking down the distribution of power further, we can let each of these new territories act as their own sister republics.

 reporg_events.15.d: "In a move surprising no one, the revolutionary traitors of Oregon have decided to go back on their deal and not hand over the territories of High and Low Puget. This serves as a perfect example of the Californian approach to diplomacy. We can only hope to never fall for this sort of trickery again in the future."

 reporg_events.18.t: "New Beliefs"
 reporg_events.18.d: "We have recently been approached by an ambassador of one of the new heretic faiths of the south. The message which she preached was greatly convincing. The tales of the President’s supremacy were hard to believe even when we were under its spell. Now that we are free from the Union’s constraints we can see the wider picture of The Founder’s creation. These supposed “heretics” have really taken off within our state and caused many of our own citizens to join their ranks. Each day that passes, more Partisans recognize the constructed nature of their belief., a great Presidential lie. The only question that remains is if we are brave enough to step beyond the lessons of tradition and embrace this new truth."
