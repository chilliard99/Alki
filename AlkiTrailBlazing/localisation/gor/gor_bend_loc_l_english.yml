 river_trade_bend: "River Trade"
 river_trade_bend_desc: "By the mid 15th century, the county of Bend had successfully expanded its commercial network to become the most dominant power in the Cascadian trade. This influence mostly came from the Deschutes river, a vital body which connects the Inland Empire and Jefferson to the Pacific trade. Merchants from across the Union’s east border flocked to Bend to have their goods ferried further east. The merchants of Bend always obliged their requests, selling the new goods at ludicrous markups to the people of Washington and Jefferson."
 wavering_allegiances_bend: "Wavering Allegiances"
 wavering_allegiances_bend_desc: "While they historically declared themselves to be Progressives, it was well known among members of the empire that Bend had a wavering allegiance to the President’s party. In truth, it was this double allegiance that led the Traditionalists to argue for the existence of the Bend duchy. Originally the river would have been split between the duke of Goose and a new free city based out of The Dalles. We have maintained close ties with the Traditionalists due to their advocacy and hope to continue to grow closer in the future."
 glory_robbed_bend: "Glory Robbed"
 glory_robbed_bend_desc: "Oregon was reorganized in the wake of the Redwood Campaign by a collection of Traditionalist diplomats and the Napan President. As part of their plan, east Oregon was to be dominated by a new trans-Jeffersonian state known as Deschutes. It would have been led by the influential duke of Lakeview before the idea was abandoned in exchange for the region’s shattered state. The dream of a united Deschutes state still lives on in many of our citizens’ minds. Perhaps one day we will rejoin our brothers in the south and revive the dream of a mighty nation in East Oregon."
 union_sweetheart_bend: "Union Sweetheart"
 union_sweetheart_bend_desc: "While the Union’s craftsmen, farmers, and miners produce plentiful amounts of unique goods, there have historically been some products which the Californians rely on foreign trade for. Among the most prominent of these was sugar. Sugar for sweetening sauces or baked goods has routinely come from beets grown by the Plainwalkers and Metis. Californians routinely paid exorbitant prices to sate their sweet tooths before the intervention of the Duchess of Madras. Seeing a gap in the market, the Duchess bought several caravan loads of the crop from the east and established large sugar plantations outside of the capital. Ever since the Union has relied upon the hard working farmers of Madras to provide them their sugar fix."
 young_brian_bend: "Young Brian"
 young_brian_bend_desc: "The ascension of Brian Putnam as the Count of Bend served as an important marker for the region’s development. Young Brian was the first ruler to not have participated within the Redwood Campaign or War of The Mad, being too young at the time. While the war’s scars still dominated the region, many saw in Brian a chance to move forward. By the end of Brian’s rule, Oregon would be almost unrecognizable after various wars, revolts, and attempts to leave the Union."
 eastern_capital_bend: "Eastern Capital"
 eastern_capital_bend_desc: "Once the Redwood crusaders took the city of Portland, many of its former Republican loyalists fled eastward to the city of Bend where they believed they would be able to further resist the invaders. Instead, the house of Putnam led a popular revolt against the Republicans, arresting their traitorous lot and handing them over to the Redwoods. Those that escaped fled even further east. For a few short months, Bend was the official capital of the Oregonian Republic. During this brief period, the city saw its population balloon and widespread development. The signs of this occupation can still be seen along the city streets in the abandoned houses and wide marketplaces."
 deschutes_dream_bend: "Deschutes Dream"
 deschutes_dream_bend_desc: "As the most powerful nation in east Oregon, it is our dream to one day march south and unite the Deschutes and its tributaries under one banner. Our soldiers wait restlessly for the day when they may gloriously march through the streets of Lakeview and test their mettle against the legendary Redwoods. Until such days come, we must prepare and ensure that our forces will be ready to come out victorious in the war for the Deschutes."

 deschutes_alliance_bend_title: "Deschutes Alliance"
 deschutes_alliance_bend_desc: "The Deschutes river is a powerful tool which can be wielded for uses outside of the purely economic. There are many nations which rely on our control of the river to ferry their goods along the Columbia river. If we were to leverage this reliance into maintaining alliances, we could potentially form a cartel. Through mutual domination of the Jeffersonian, Inland Empire, and Cascadian markets, we can ensure that all members of such a cartel mutually prosper."

As it stands, we are the most prominent economic power within the Cascadian market. Our true task is maintaining this dominance and growing our lead to the point where no other nations can rival our economic hegemony.

 invest_in_the_bend_bend_desc: "To further cement our dominance of the Cascadian market, it would be prudent to invest in the major ports along the Deschutes. Among the most important for these aims are the cities of Bend and the Dalles. Bend is the namesake of our state and home to our nation’s capital. Its success reflects directly on our administration. The Dalles serves as our connection to the Columbia. With further development, we can turn the city into a necessary stop for river vessels from further north."

Our modern luxuries of exchange and currency make the process of trade much easier. Despite this, there is still so much more to improve and learn. The scholars of our day have come up with myriad different ideas to help foster growth. Let our nation be the place where they can be put in action."

 oregonian_classicalism_bend_title: "Oregonian Classicalism"
 oregonian_classicalism_bend_desc: "While the Northern Classical movement of Washington focused on the natural world and The Founder’s creation and the mainstream Classical movement of Liberty focused on humanity and rationalism, Oregonian Classicalism served as a hybrid of the two philosophies. The more harsh tones of secularism were removed from the southern movement and refined into a merger between man and the divine. Many pieces which have defined the Classicalist movement, such as Elta O'Connell’s sculpture of The Spirit of Liberty, actually come from further north in Oregon rather than Liberty." 
 deschutes_artwork_bend_title: "Deschutes Artwork"
 deschutes_artwork_bend_desc: "The Deschutes School was a brief artistic collective which formed in the city of The Dalles during the late 15th century. Its members were composed of Libertarians who had ventured north to get away from the elitism that had emerged among the southern artists. They spread many of the techniques of perspective and proportions to Oregonian artists who used them to further improve their craft." 
 ready_the_men_bend_title: "Ready The Soldiery"
 ready_the_men_bend_desc: "Call upon all sons and daughters of the land. Tell them it is time to raise their arms in support of a faint dream. A dream that once lingered as a promise from the lips of those in power. Never again will they trust that traitorous lot. We must make our own destiny. Rise up worthy fighters and ready yourselves for war!" 
 tenino_tragedy_bend_title: "Tenino Tragedy"
 tenino_tragedy_bend_desc: "The first step in our expansion beyond the Deschutes should be in claiming further ports along the Columbia river. Out of our two avenues for expansion, the Tenino of Warmsprings are the obvious choice. Their isolation and foreign culture make them the perfect target for our aims. Just as their ancestors fell to the might of the Oregonian Republic, they will fall again to the power of Californian arms." 
 the_hard_part_bend_title: "The Hard Part"
 the_hard_part_bend_desc: "As we continue to elevate the status of our nation, some have begun to wonder if it is truly worth it to carry on to the dream of uniting the Deschutes. Of course, many of our citizens still long for the opportunity to claim what was once promised to them, yet some of the wiser among our state have begun to think if a goal of Oregonian unity may be more worthwhile in the long run. As we work to mop up the remaining territories that lie outside of our reach it would be wise to keep these perspectives in mind." 
 pruning_the_prines_bend_title: "Pruning The Prines"
 pruning_the_prines_bend_desc: "To fund our further expansion we need a large class of rich nobles we can rely upon for easy tax income. Perhaps the simplest way for us to accomplish this would be conquering the lands of Morrow-Crook to our east. In the early days of the Oregonian Republic, countless rich nobles fled east in an attempt to get away from what they believed would be a state full of radicals. Many of these historic families have remained in the region. Their wealth would greatly assist us in our future expansions."

 klamath_hijinks_bend_title: "Klamath Hijinks"
 klamath_hijinks_bend_desc: "Klamath is a historic state of Jefferson which holds close ties to the citizens of Goose in the east. Any nation which rises out of the area will no doubt contest our claim to the title of Deschutes. Further, control of the city of Ashland and Klamath Falls will greatly assist us in defending against incursions from the south. Holding onto Kalamath would be our best bet that control over the Deschutes is maintained into future generations." 
 promised_capital_bend_title: "Promised Capital"
 promised_capital_bend_desc: "The original capital of the Deschutes state was to be based out of the city of Lakeview. The former duke, Marc Crook, was a good friend of the Napan president. It was probably due to this camaraderie that the Traditionalists took back their idea of a united Deschutes state. Regardless of the history, claiming the city of Lakeview will be a necessity if we wish to proclaim ourselves the heirs to the Deschutes promise." 
 slaying_the_salemites_bend_title: "Slaying The Salemites"
 slaying_the_salemites_bend_desc: "Salem, while not serving as the capital of the Oregonian Republic, has long been cast as the historical center of the Oregonian region for its former role as the capital of the province of Oregon under the American empire. It now lies independent as a Free City of the union. If we claw the city from that mayor’s control we can restore it to its former glory and use Salem as a base to plan our further invasions west." 
 pacific_promise_bend_title: "Pacific Promise"
 pacific_promise_bend_desc: "As a primarily land based nation, the task of taking the Oregonian coast will certainly be a challenging one. Once we wrangle control of their key ports, we will have finally completed the task of forming a united Oregon. For our future endeavors it would be wise to remember the ease of conquest and difficulty of rule. We have done well to unite these lands, now let us begin the task of administration."

 wasting_away_willamette_bend_desc: "The lower Willamette has recovered gracefully from its destruction during The War of The Mad. The vast vineyards have spun into production of their signature vintages once again. The beating heart of the area, Eugene, stands proud as a shining example of Oregonian recovery. It would do us well to tread lightly in our conquest of the area. Too much work has gone into restoring these lands to destroy them once again."

 bend_events.1.t: "Three Star League"
 bend_events.1.d: "Trade in the Union of California is a difficult game. Every duke scrambles for control of vital ports and influence over the merchants. Such competition is encouraged by the President whose domineering power naturally accrues influence. Truly though, the competition serves no purpose. We would be far better off taking after the baronies of old and reaching out to other dukes to form a sort of cartel. Such an arrangement existed briefly during the 11th century as a means to combat the tide of Dachian influence from the north. A collection of Jeffersonian and Oregonian dukes banded together to create the Three Star League. Technically the league still exists today, though a shadow of its former self. Some of our economic advisors have posited that with the right spin, we could convince our allies throughout the Inland Empire and Jefferson markets to join a refurbished version of this organization. The league holds historical legitimacy and a strong purpose in combating Presidential influence. Together, our nations will control the tides of trade and ensure that those that deserve prosperity are free to grasp it."

 bend_events.2.d: "We have just received a message from [From.GetName] inviting us to join their new “Three Star League.” The league is a historic body which once worked to combat the influence of the barons of Washington.  By joining their ranks we will effectively have a cooperative monopoly over the Jeffersonian and Inland Empire markets. Such control will greatly expand our economic influence and tie our nations closer together. While we will be giving up some autonomy to accomplish this, such a small price to pay will be more than worth it for our future economic potential. Hopefully, the other nations of the organization see this value and continue to hold up their end of the bargain. It will require all of our participation to ensure success."
 bend_events.2.a: "Our Thanks To [From.GetName]"
 bend_events.3.t: "Promises, Promises"
 bend_events.3.d: "The architects of Oregon after The War of The Mad were a collection of Traditionalist dukes and the Napan President. During the process of their negotiations, east Oregon was planned to be united under a single state known as Deschutes. At one point, all of the Oregonian Cascades, Morrow-Crook, Bend, and Goose were slated to be part of this expansive duchy. Disagreements over the ruler of such a state invariably led to its fall, yet some in our nation have continued to believe in the promise of a united Deschutes state. Such a nation would combine people of High Oregonian, Oregonian, and Jeffersonian culture under one banner. Our conquests of Oregon have centered around this aim. However, upon further reflection some have begun to question if this path forward would be sustainable. A state full of such diversity could fall to factionalism and eventually rebellion. Further, the loose promise of Deschutes state, while important to our citizens, has little support across the Union. Perhaps it would be more politically prudent if we dedicated ourselves to uniting the Oregonians instead. The question now before us is whether we should continue to pursue that faint dream or transition to a more grounded goal."

 bend_events.4.t: "Lakeview Directive" 
 bend_events.4.d: "The duke of Lakeview, Marc Crook, held close ties to the Napan President. They fought side by side on the battlefield against Lewis the Mad. During the peace negotiations, Crook was guaranteed control of a state in Jefferson. It was the President’s dream that this state be a vast electorate which stretched across east Oregon and Jefferson. The Traditionalists initially supported this aim, but negotiations eventually fell through over the topic of control. One of the central threads of these negotiations was the status of Lakeview as the capital of the Deschutes state. Our conquest of Lakeview now tasks us with choosing whether to declare the city as our capital or maintain our ruler from Bend. Bend serves as a better location for trade due to its presence along the Deschutes, but Lakeview holds historical legitimacy. While Bend may already be better developed, Lakeview’s sparer status makes it ideal for expansion. We must consider all of these factors before deciding our next steps forward."
