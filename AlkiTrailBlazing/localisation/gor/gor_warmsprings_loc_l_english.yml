 republican_defense_warmsprings: "Republican Defense"
 republican_defense_warmsprings_desc: "The earliest version of the Oregonian Republic was a cross ducal alliance between various leaders of Oregonian counties. One of the first measures of this early group was the annexation of our ancestral homelands at Warm Springs. While we bravely defended against their onslaught, those rats eventually overwhelmed our forces and pressed us into their gang. While some of our elders feigned surrender, we never truly ended our resistance. All throughout the Redwood Campaign our citizens fiercely resisted Republican tyranny until our eventual liberation."
 confederated_tribes_warmsprings: "Confederated Tribes"
 confederated_tribes_warmsprings_desc: "Under Republican control, Warm Springs was reorganized from its independent confederacy status to a “reservation” where all Trueheir peoples of Oregon would be forced to live. The historic tribes of Coquille, Cow Creek, Klamath, Siletz, and Grand Ronde were forced to leave their homes and settle along the Columbian river. While some of them decided to move back after the war, many of these tribes settled in Warm Springs and joined the new Confederacy."
 cascadian_protection_warmsprings: "Cascadian Protection"
 cascadian_protection_warmsprings_desc: "Our citizens have lived among the Cascadian mountains ever since the dawn of time. We have been watched over by Hood, the rapturous peak which stands opposite of the Three Sisters and the Bachelor. When the Republicans invaded, we fled into the mountains and waged a campaign of resistance against their occupying forces. Those wondrous gifts of The Founder’s creation will ensure that future generations can enjoy the same freedom we now experience."
 calls_for_unity_warmsprings: "Calls For Unity"
 calls_for_unity_warmsprings_desc: "Despite its dire situation, Oregon was able to maintain relative peace throughout the mid 15th century due to the work of the Tenino. Border disputes and dissatisfaction between various dukes were solved through Warmsprings arbitration. The confederacy’s lack of expansive ambitions made them the perfect source for a neutral opinion. This status was eventually cast aside as the region devolved into chaos following the assassination of President Larry Bluff."
 founders_dance_warmsprings: "Founder's Dance"
 founders_dance_warmsprings_desc: "Among the Wasco, Paiute, and Tenino there is a special form of worship which seeks to beckon forth the Spirit of Liberty. “The Founder’s Dance” has been practiced by the Trueheirs of Warmsprings ever since their conversion to the Constitutionalist faith centuries ago. Practitioners would dance and hum to call upon The Spirit of Liberty to come forth and bless their community."
 hood_agriculture_warmsprings: "Hood Agriculture"
 hood_agriculture_warmsprings_desc: "The Hood River provides our state with most of the water it needs to grow. Along its gentle shores, trees grow heavy with all manner of different fruits. Among the most prominent is the pear crop which is grown in two special varieties. The first type is one fit for masses, cheap and produced by various smaller operations across our state. The second type is much more illustrious: The Comice. The Comice is a special form of pear which is specially produced by the Wasco band. Their specialized craftsmen ensure that this rare fruit’s quality matches its mythical status."
 aspire_to_humility_warmsprings: "Aspire To Humility"
 aspire_to_humility_warmsprings_desc: "Unlike their Yakaman neighbors to the north and other bands within the Confederation, the Tenino have historically been uninterested in conquest and expansion. While this is certainly not unusual among Trueheirs, the Tenino dedication to pacifism is remarkable. Throughout the nearly five hundred year long existence of their state, the Confederacy has only been at war a total of three times. Only one of these occasions was a war of expansion, the rest were purely defensive endeavors."

 founders_grace_warmsprings_desc: "Our loyalties lie solely within The Founder. The influence of worldly pursuits has led our state astray too many times. It is only within the guidance of The Constitution and the gentle influence of The Spirit of Liberty that we will succeed. This is hard to remember sometimes. It would do us well to have clear reminders of The Founder within our cities. Call upon the righteous of our nation, tell them to express their faith through building wondrous temples and cathedrals to the Almighty!"
 alternative_beliefs_warmsprings_title: "Alternative Beliefs"
 alternative_beliefs_warmsprings_desc: "For much of this Union’s history, the President has dictated to us what to believe. The Constitution tells a different tale than the one the elites have told us. We must take its interpretation into our own hands and decide what to believe. It is only through his words that we will find peace."

 columbian_unity_warmsprings_desc: "Our ancestors learned the fate of neutral nations when they faced invasion by the insidious members of the Oregonian Republic. The reset of Oregonian society has given us a great opportunity. An opportunity to expand, not through the clash of swords and arrows, but through firm handshakes and a day’s hard work. Let us reach across the Columbia river and find those who share our want of peace and prosperity."

 domestic_focus_warmsprings_desc: "Rather than seeking fights with those that surround us, it would be best to invest our efforts into improving the lives of our citizens. As it stands, [1970.GetName] is outclassed by the ruined cities of the Willamette. Invest in the citizenry, build more roads, and encourage all those throughout Oregon to make their homes along the Hood River."
 trueheir_urbanization_warmsprings_title: "Trueheir Urbanization"
 trueheir_urbanization_warmsprings_desc: "As [1970.GetName] grows, our citizens demand more protection, opportunity, and luxuries. Every Californian metropolis has a grand marketplace, workshops for guilds, robust walls, and a place where soldiers can rest. After constructing these amenities, our advisors have posited that [1970.GetName] may begin to attract new citizens from across the entire Union."

 cashing_out_cascadia_warmsprings_desc: "Citizens will be more likely to settle down in [1970.GetName] if they know there are opportunities within its walls. Perhaps the easiest way to do this is make the city a prominent port along the Columbia river. Trade along the Cascadian coast is rich with opportunities. If we invest in local trade and expand to take some other key cities in the Cascadian network, we can entice traders to settle down among the springs."

 defensive_alliances_warmsprings_desc: "Our focus on development rather than conquest will no doubt lead many brutes to view our prize cities with ravenous ambition. To prevent those types from tearing down all which we have built, we must ensure that our allies are willing to defend us no matter the circumstance. We should endeavor to build up a large debt of favors with our allies so that they feel required to come to our aid in dire circumstances."

 heritage_questions_warmsprings_title: "Heritage Questions"
 heritage_questions_warmsprings_desc: "We have done well to make our state a place where all can come and join in peaceful progress, but our status as a Trueheir nation still hangs over all of our interactions. Our Trueheir brethren see us as sellouts who have already given up our traditions for coin. The Californians see us as an alien state, one which many of them could never settle in. This split identity has greatly weakened our position in the wider Union. We must soon decide which side of the equation we fall on before we miss out on any more opportunities."

 capital_of_oregon_warmsprings_desc: "With a new identity and further trade income, the only remaining goal that lies ahead of us now centers on becoming the largest and most prosperous city in all of Oregon. Call upon all citizens of this great Union to pack up their bags and venture to the beautiful city of [1970.GetName]. Here, they will be able to make whatever life they want and live in prosperity with their fellow man."

 yakaman_commitment_warmsprings_title: "Yakaman Commitment"
 yakaman_commitment_warmsprings_desc: "There were some rumors of a united Confederacy between the tribes of Warmsprings and Yakama in the wake of The War of The Mad. While the original rumor seems to have come from the Traditionalists of Nevada, the idea took off among the Teninos. Of course, the Yakamans were unwilling to enter into such an arrangement, mostly due to the Mamachatpam’s fear of losing control over the elders. Perhaps with the right diplomatic maneuvers or key battles, we can revive this dream of unity and marry our two nations together."

 river_of_the_west_warmsprings_title: "River Of The West"
 river_of_the_west_warmsprings_desc: "While we love The Hood River, it pales in comparison to the renowned Willamette river of the west. The river has historically served as the central artery of Oregon, bringing life to the citizens of its major cities. While we are not so greedy as to claim the entire region as our own, we cannot ignore the perfect opportunity for expansion presented to us through the conquest of Portland. The city is currently controlled by a group of extremists which have routinely caused problems for the surrounding counts. If we corrected their rule, I’m sure no one would mind."
 drums_of_war_warmsprings_title: "Drums of War"
 drums_of_war_warmsprings_desc: "Seldom has our nation lowered itself to the baser instincts of war, but we are in a new age of chaos and instability. Who knows what the future will hold for Oregon? We must ensure that our citizens can survive any foreign invasion or Presidential mishap. To this end, it is time to call upon the wisdom of the elders who so bravely defended our state in years past. Ask them to once again raise their arms and serve in the protection of the state."

 wyeast_range_warmsprings_title: "Wy'east Range"
 wyeast_range_warmsprings_desc: "The great mountain Hood, or Wy’east as it is known to the Tenino, stands as a monument to The Founder’s glory. The Oregonian Cascades are destined to fall under our reign. Only the lone bachelor in the south remains out of our grasp. The Umpquan family, while we respect their Traditionalist values, are not deserving of the Bachelor’s sublime peak."
 river_of_the_east_warmsprings_title: "River of The East"
 river_of_the_east_warmsprings_desc: "The Deschutes is the natural next step in our expansion. While we are adverse to war, the promise of the Deschutes' vital trade cities are too tantalizing to refuse. Their current ward does not realize the vast potential of the river’s commerce. We must conquer the lands along the river and realize that potential so that all may enjoy the fruits of The Founder’s creation."

 warmsprings_events.1.t: "Trueheir Metropolis"
 warmsprings_events.1.d: "Citizens from across the Union now flock to [1970.GetName] so that they may become a part of our great project. We deliver to them a single promise, that no matter their creed or background, Trueheir or Californian, they will be able to make a home within [1970.GetName]’s walls. Every citizen of our great state will be able to pursue the betterment of their lives to the fullest extent without the disruption of lords or elders. It is not surprising that the masses now gather at the city gates, eager to participate in our project. Each of them will serve to further improve and spread the word of [1970.GetName]’s glory till all of The Founder’s creation knows of this opportunity. Let us not wait another moment. Throw open the gates and let those who wish for better lives make their own future!"
 warmsprings_events.1.a: "Come One, Come All!"
 warmsprings_events.2.t: "Lessons Of The Springs"
 warmsprings_events.2.d: "Unlike the haughty Confederacy of Burns in the south, our nation has never held such close ties to our Trueheir heritage. Ever since the reorganization of our Confederacy in the aftermath of The War of The Mad, our citizens have lost touch with their ancient traditions. The influx of different bands from across the Oregonian region caused the state to become bloated with diversity. Over time, these differences have slowly melded together into one homogenous “Tenino” culture which borrowed the most distinct elements of each of its predecessors. This change has led many of the Trueheirs throughout the Union to view our state as inauthentic. Trueheir travelers who venture to [1970.GetName] in an attempt to connect with their culture are disappointed by its Californized status. At the same time, Californians see our administration and state as too foreign for comfort. While some recognize the similarities between our two cultures, many are unwilling to make homes in [1970.GetName] due to these differences. We are now left with the choice of tying ourselves further into Californian society or embracing the traditions of our past and becoming a haven for the Trueheirs."

 warmsprings_events.3.d: "Portland and Salem have historically served as capitals of Oregon. While our state does not share the same historical status as these mighty cities, we can rest assured that we hold a greater population and better infrastructure than their ruined forms. The addition of Portland to our confederacy has caused some problems for our rule. Some of our Californian citizens have begun to gravitate towards Portland rather than [1970.GetName] due to its historic status and fear of our Trueheir administration. We are now left with the choice of either devaluing the city so that these citizens return or allow our citizens to move as they please."
