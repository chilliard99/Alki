 home_of_the_astors_astoria: "Home Of The Astors"
 home_of_the_astors_astoria_desc: "Some say Astoria was named after the Astors. Others claim that the reverse is true, that the Astors adopted the city’s name for their own. Whatever the case, their house has held great influence along the Oregonian coast for centuries. The Astors were present at almost every major event in the Union’s history. When the Oregonians came together to create a new republic, it was led by the Astors. The first president of the Oregonian republic, Titus Astor, was a member of their house. Though their family is bruised and battered, the Astor network of familial relations and diplomatic moles continue to exert their influence across the Union."
 old_disappointment_astoria: "Old Disappointment"
 old_disappointment_astoria_desc: "The mouth of the Columbia river is a violent and deadly beast. Among sailors it has earned the name “Graveyard of the Pacific.” It takes an experienced seaman to brave her bar crossing, a fact that has led to financial ruin each year. In order to combat this loss of revenue, a joint venture between the Dach family of Washington and the Astors funded the creation of a large lighthouse by the river’s mouth. This structure greatly aided sailors in safely returning to shore, which led many to sarcastically refer to the new lighthouse as “Great Disappointment” or “Old Disappointment.”"
 cheeselords_astoria: "Cheeselords"
 cheeselords_astoria_desc: "Californians as a whole are renowned for their artistry. The effort that they put into the production of even the most mundane goods impresses foreign travelers. Nowhere is this more clear than in Tillamook where a collection of wealthy lords have devoted their entire lives to the production of fine cheeses. These Cheeselords create a product that is frequently paired with Willamette wines to create the quintessential Oregonian meal. The wealth generated from this cheesy export has netted these nobles great influence within our nation."
 fist_of_the_pomo_astoria: "Fist Of The Pomo"
 fist_of_the_pomo_astoria_desc: "Elisa Astor was the last remaining member of her family following The Redwood Campaign in Oregon. Her brothers, sisters, parents, nieces, and nephews were all slaughtered, either by the invading Jeffersonians or revolutionaries. The “Terror of the North” and “Fist of the Pomo”, Elmer Quitiquit conquered much of the Oregonian coast during the campaign. In the aftermath of his brutal siege of Astoria, Elmer proposed to Elisa and took her on as his wife. Their relationship was held up as a hopeful ideal for the future of Oregon. Elisa’s cooperation with the Napan presidency and Elmer’s fame after the war gave their rule a powerful legitimacy. Some have even speculated that Elmer was under consideration to be the elector for Oregon, but his Trueheir heritage led the Traditionalists to dismiss the notion."
 dominate_tillamook_astoria: "Dominate Tillamook"
 dominate_tillamook_astoria_desc: "The land is still scarred from the actions of those barbaric Redwoods. All across this region the humble farmer cries out for aid and the efficacious artisan begs for renewal. While we have so much to deal with in our own borders, not taking advantage of this disunity would be a huge mistake. Rally the men, no matter their plight, and tell them to march south. All of Oregon’s sublime coasts will be made whole under our reign!"
 snuff_out_republicanism_astoria: "Snuff Out Republicanism"
 snuff_out_republicanism_astoria_desc: "In every dark corner and seedy establishment, the damned Sons of Oregon plot to overthrow our state and restore their crooked order. While those that came before them held noble aims, all that remain are radicals and savages who wish to see mankind return to a state of primitivism. We must stay one step ahead of their plans to protect the royal family and prevent the chaos of ‘28 from returning."
 classical_legacy_astoria: "Classical Legacy"
 classical_legacy_astoria_desc: "Before the foundation of the Union, even before the conquest of these lands by Jesus of the Salt Lake, Astoria was part of a thriving maritime empire. The Classical city states of South Bay and the Joaquin created settlements along the pacific coast. We still hold these times close to our identity, seeing our current pursuits as an extension of our ancestor’s goals all those years ago."

 ja_system_astoria_pomo_desc: "Rather than dividing our state into a system of different lordships or fiefs, it is more proper to let all manner of citizens own land and rule over them accordingly. The Ja System dictates that every homestead is taxed according to its local production and is given representation before the chieftain accordingly."
 pan_pomo_alliance_astoria_pomo: "Pan-Pomo Alliance"
 pan_pomo_alliance_astoria_pomo_desc: "Our brothers to the far south have languished under the thumb of the Napan emperor for too long. Through family feuds and all manner of natural disaster, they have been made subservient to those in the east. It is our duty as their family to free them of this state of affairs and collaborate with them to usher in a new age of prosperity for the Pomo."
 northern_dialect_astoria_pomo: "Northern Dialect"
 northern_dialect_astoria_pomo_desc: "Our great founder, Elmer Quitiquit, bore a different tongue than many of the Pomo further south. In the hallowed halls of their government the only allowed language is Kashaya. Elmer was raised among the poor of Fort Bragg, so he never learned Kashaya. He passed the tongue of his people, Northern Pomo, onto his son. We shall pass on this language to all those who come after, so that they never forget our origins."

 coastliners_astoria_pomo_desc: "The wide open sea calls to us in a peculiar way. Its gentle embrace spells freedom for our people. Forever we have been blocked by the constricting hands of Traditionalists or apathetic presidents. Call out to all those whose hearts ache for the seas, tell them they will have a place under our sails!"
 yakaman_rivals_astoria_pomo: "Yakaman Rivals"
 yakaman_rivals_astoria_pomo_desc: "At the dawn of the 16th century, the status of Trueheir people in California began to look more and more troublesome. The Napan president had refused to confirm their native land rights and the new Renoian president declined to comment on the issue. The Yakamans of Washington, particularly Lane Wallahee, began to take on a more leading role. They called for the formation of a wider Trueheir state involving every similar count in the Union. The main opposition for this movement came from the sizeable noble Pomo population of Astoria. Their careful negotiations prevented a mass Trueheir exit in exchange for a recognition of their traditional land rights."
 oregonian_refuge_astoria_pomo: "Oregonian Refuge"
 oregonian_refuge_astoria_pomo_desc: "We can make use of our neutral status in Oregon to help negotiate a peace between the radicals and monarchs. The Sons of Oregon have long terrorized their brethren from the shadows, but we believe that they are simply misguided. A nice sit down between all parties could go a long way in mending these broken ties."
 pacific_conquest_astoria_pomo: "Pacific Conquest"
 pacific_conquest_astoria_pomo_desc: "The wide blue expanse taunts us. It begs for unity. All up and down this coast, Californian counts waste her precious gifts. We are not like them. We will wage war against the ungrateful until all of the Pacific lies under our grasp."

Elmer’s coastal campaign ended with the long siege of Astoria. In victory he marched through the city streets and took a prize in the form of the mayor's widow. Now it is time to clean up the mess we have made and restore Astoria to its former glory."
 cascadian_monument_astoria_title: "Cascadian Monument"
 cascadian_monument_astoria_desc: "The fight for naval supremacy during The War of The Mad was even more brutal than the land campaign. The majority of the Union’s navy had an undying loyalty to the crazed president. It was their vessels, alongside the seamen of Oregon, that met the Redwood navy along the coast. As part of their operation to secure naval supremacy, Redwood soldiers destroyed the Old Disappointment lighthouse. Now that the war is over, our sailors are struggling to overcome the Columbian river’s violent mouth to dock at port.

 milking_our_advantage_astoria_title: "Milking Our Advantage"
 milking_our_advantage_astoria_desc: "Tillamook is renowned for its dairy industry. Long ago, after studying the techniques and craftsmanship of vintners along the Willamette, a young farmer named Skyla Altenwerth carefully created a pallet of artisanal cheeses that were specifically made to be paired with Oregonian wines. She taught her craft to a collection of other artisans who, in turn, expanded her recipes and began to accelerate production. Their work created that cheesy good that Tillamook is best known for today. The War of The Mad was not kind to the dairy farmers, as most of their cattle were slaughtered to feed the hungry invaders. We must develop the local industries so that they may produce this luxury once again."

 curtailing_cheeselords_astoria_desc: "The humble artisans who once found nobility in cheesemaking slowly began to use their wealth to influence aspects of the state. They purchased more and more plots of land and began to rival the power of the crown. These “Cheeselords” have started to pose a threat to our rule. We must work diligently to ensure that they do not eclipse our power with their cheesy wiles."

 tillamook_fleet_astoria_desc: "Dominance of the waves leads to dominance of the land. This adage is never more true than along the Pacific coast. Commerce across its gentle waves guides the fate of the Californias. If we wish to leave a mark on this land or even make some quick coin, we must have a robust navy to carry out our aims. Developing the docks of Clatsop, hiring an expert on the matter, and building more ships will ensure that we remain commercial and navally competitive."

Through his monumental efforts, the entirety of Tillamook was conquered in just two short years. For his loyalty to the Napan president and excellence in conquest, Elmer was granted lands along the Oregonian coast and, more importantly, the city of Astoria. Under Elmer’s leadership, the cities of Astoria and Tillamook have had time to recover from their destruction during the Redwood campaign. Despite all of this, some are concerned for the future of this arrangement. Elmer is a member of the Pomo Trueheir people and has routinely granted important positions to his kin. Some fear that his son will continue this treatment and slowly turn Astoria into a Trueheir nation."

The artisans behind the creation of this gouda have decided they’ve had enough. Inspired by similar movements in Washington, most of these artisans have banded together and formed a cooperative. This body wishes to transfer ownership from the Cheeselords to the artisans who will collectively own all of the assets of the industry. The issue has made its way to [Root.Monarch.GetName] who must decide whether the cooperative should be allowed to exist. The Cheeselords maintain that it is their recipes and their investments that allowed the artisans to learn their craft in the first place. They also argue that cheese production could suffer since the artisans may be unwilling to train aspiring fromagineers in order to consolidate their power. The artisans claim that the recipes are the common heritage of the Oregonians and that they are entitled to own what they create. Of course, curbing the power of the Cheeselords is an attractive prospect for our rule. Members of their class have been meddling in the affairs of our state since we began our rule. However, we must also consider that consolidating all of the cheese industry under these artisans may lead to an even worse problem. If they act in unison, the artisans could have the full economic might of the dairy industry behind them.

Under his watchful eye our county has recovered from The War of The Mad and led Oregon into a new age of peace and prosperity. However, upon his death, many were left concerned as to the future of the state. All eyes fell upon the runt Coboway Quitiquit. His older brother, first in line for the throne, had died in 1443 before he had the chance to lead the nation. Coboway was seen as weak to all those around him, being short in stature and grossly rotund. Upon his ascension to the throne he was faced with the difficult choice of maintaining the path of his father’s administration or following the popular opinion. Elmer began a campaign of national Pomoization, wherein he would promote Trueheir citizens to high offices just on the basis of their heritage. Many allowed Elmer to continue this practice because of his domineering status, but expected that whoever came after would integrate into Oregonian society. Dawning the crown of Astoria and sitting on the gilded throne, it is time for Coboway to choose a path."

 astoria_events.3.t: "Republican Legacy"
 astoria_events.3.d: "The fight for Oregonian Republicanism was a long and arduous one, beginning earlier in the 15th century with a diplomatic meeting in the city of Portland. Led by the Astor family, this group almost was able to secure a united future for the Oregonians, but they were stopped by a Traditionalist coalition. The dream of a united Oregon was smashed with the Redwood invasion of the early republic. Those savages slaughtered almost every level head and patriot. What was left was a den of radicals who terrorize our state to this day. With the restoration of the Astor dynasty, some believe that the Oregonian republic will be reformed any day now. The Sons of Oregon have already made contact with [Root.Monarch.GetName] and are ready to join our state if we help their cause. Should we go forth and revive the dream of an Oregonian Republic or is such a motion too dangerous?"

 astoria_events.4.d: "The Sons of Oregon have finally been dealt with by [From.GetName]. Their brave soldiers rooted out that filth from every nook and cranny. No longer will our citizens live in fear of their terroristic intentions. We can breathe a sigh of relief and focus on uniting the Union rather than fearing for our own lives."
 astoria_events.4.a: "A Glorious Day"
 astoria_events.5.t: "Tribal Legacy"
 astoria_events.5.d: "There is only one remaining step in converting our administration over to Trueheir tradition and that is switching up our government. For centuries, the Trueheir peoples of California have found novel ways to govern their own people. Usually unity comes from the domineering influence of a single chieftain whose guidance ensures that the realm does not fall into chaos. Most Trueheir nations have further organization split between a series of bands, or tribes, who each hold a portion of land and swear fealty to high chieftains. If we wish to brand ourselves as a member of the wider Trueheir community, we should take on this form of government. Alternatively we could take on the monarchy that governs own brethren to the south. If we want to maintain our image as a state for all people, regardless of Trueheir status, we should continue our current rule."

 astoria_events.6.t: "Trueheir Unity"
 astoria_events.6.d: "As the years drag on, it becomes more and more clear that the president has no interest in preserving the Trueheir people of the Union. We must band together if we wish to preserve our traditions in the face of Californian occupation. To this extent, we should reach out to our neighbors in Warmsprings to try and convince them to join us as a vassal. Under our reign they will be free to practice as they wish free from the Californian menace. Let us hope they see this reason and accept our generous terms."

 astoria_events.7.t: "Eastern Requests"
 astoria_events.7.d: "We have just received word from the east. Apparently the Pomo of [From.GetName] have demanded that we become their vassals. Such terms seem to come from a place of love rather than greed, but it's hard to not see them as an insult. Supposedly they believe that we would be better off under their control than braving the Union alone. While we are sure that the President cares not for the preservation of our people, is subjugation really the right solution? We must carefully consider their offer and decide for ourselves if it is worth it."

Together our nations will forge a new world out of Oregon, one where no Trueheirs will be left behind. We will ensure that all people, no matter their creed or color, are given the peace to live as they wish."

 astoria_events.10.t: "House of Quitiquit"
 astoria_events.10.d: "Elmer Quitiquit was a member of the Pomo. He grew up in the wilds outside of Fort Bragg. At the age of 11 he left his home and traveled north to Crescent City. There, through hard work and grit, he rose the ranks to become an advisor to Grandmaster of the Redwoods. When The War of The Mad was over, he returned home in all his glory only to be snubbed by his people. The hoity-toity culture of Pomo high society had no place for his vulgar tongue. While they were drinking their fine wines and bathing in luxury, we built a powerful nation out of the north. Despite all of this, they are still our kin. War with our own family will be disastrous for both sides, so to preemptively prevent such a conflict we ought to reach out to our brothers in the south and offer them a seat at our table."

 astoria_events.11.t: "Brothers in the North"
 astoria_events.11.d: "We have just received a letter from [From.GetName] urging us to join them as a subject. While they may claim to be Pomo, their founder was of the lower Northern Pomo. He did not even speak the same tongue as most of our citizens. Now they dare even suggest that we bend our knee to them? While this offer is flatly outrageous, some of the closest advisors to [Root.Monarch.GetName] have suggested that we accept. If we do not, we may face war. Such a conflict would be disastrous for our people and theirs. We must carefully consider our next move before making any sudden judgments."

 astoria_events.14.d: "Interesting news has emerged from [From.GetName]. Apparently after conquering the electorate of Willamette, they forced the Oregonian elector to sign over their office. Now [From.GetName] represents Oregon in the Union Congress. We will need to court their vote if we wish to retain the presidency for future generations."
