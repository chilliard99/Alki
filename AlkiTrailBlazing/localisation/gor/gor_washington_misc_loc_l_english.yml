 coastal_democracy_willapa: "Coastal Democracy"
 coastal_democracy_willapa_desc: "America's Pacific coast has long held a democratic tradition. The merchants that patrol its shores often care not for the process of government, being far more concerned with making coin. The Free City of Willapa was no different, as its mayor was elected solely by the citizenry. "
 willapan_docks_willapa: "Willapan Docks"
 willapan_docks_willapa_desc: "After the War of the Mad, many Libertarian merchants were concerned with trading in Oregon. Their fear was that the residents of the area would attempt to intentionally sabotage commerce as revenge for the destruction of their republic. For this reason, many traders began to make stops in the Willapa bay rather than in Astoria or St. Helens. This phenomenon became so prevalent that the city had to invest thousands of ducats into renovating and expanding its own docks. Using some new maritime inventions from further east, the harbor became one of the most desirable locations to take a break on a long journey north."
 slow_adopters_willapa: "Slow Adopters"
 slow_adopters_willapa_desc: "In 1476, the President of the Union of California declared that all counties within would now use the Imperial Dollar as their primary currency. This unprecedented move was met with begrudging acceptance from most members of the Union except Willapa. The free city resisted the change and only accepted the old American ducat for nearly a century after most of the union had already converted to the new currency. "
 russian_legacy_willapa: "Russian Legacy"
 russian_legacy_willapa_desc: "Willapa’s settlement can be traced back to the 1st century when Russian settlers traveled south from Alaska and founded a village to trade with the American Empire. Much like the rest of Washington, the area was gradually settled by Californians and slowly came to be a part of their kingdom. Traces of this Russian legacy can still be seen in the city’s architecture and distinctive accent."
 the_columbian_collective_willapa: "The Columbian Collective"
 the_columbian_collective_willapa_desc: "As the Oregonian state began to reemerge during the 16th century and the Tacomans in the north slowly conquered more land, Willapa started to fear for its future commercial success. To remedy this, the mayor of the city attempted to reach out to the other counts of the Columbian river to create a mutual economic union. Sadly, these plans fell through and the Willapan economic influence continued to fade until its eventual demise during the Despotic Reformation."
 convenient_existance_willapa: "Convenient Existance"
 convenient_existance_willapa_desc: "The free city of Willapa came to be on a whim. Originally the city was under the control of the Senatorium of Cowlitz, but was eventually conquered by the Alaskans during their intervention in The War of the Mad. The territory was recaptured by the Redwoods during their counter offensive into Oregon. During negotiations for the peace between Alaska and the Union delegation, the city was originally going to be made a part of an Olympian electorate, but when negotiations for that fell through Willapa was given its independence. After adopting a republican form of government, the Napan president offered Willapa the opportunity to become a free city."
 talented_freinds_willapa: "Talented Friends"
 talented_freinds_willapa_desc: "The higher echelons of Willapan society had been a close knit group even before it became a republic. The Wells family, whose members were usually elected as mayor, had close ties to several of the mercenary companies of the Union. Most notably, Raymond Wells himself served as part of the Crimson Grit in the city of Tacoma after his being moved to the city by Alaskan bureaucrats. Upon becoming mayor of the Willapan state, Raymond was given a guarantee by the captain of the company that her soldiers would fight against any who challenged his rule free of charge."

 capital_of_washington_seattle: "Capital of Washington"
 capital_of_washington_seattle_desc: "Nestled in between the Puget sound and lake Washington, Seattle has been the largest city in Washington for almost a milenia. The city’s storied history consists of its founding by ancient Washingtonians, conquest at the hands of the Yakamans, independence, eventual subjugation to the American kingdom, and finally freedom under the Union. All throughout this time, merchants have filled her ports and Washingtonians have made homes behind her walls. "
 old_evergreen_seattle: "Old Siren"
 old_evergreen_seattle_desc: "The Siren league was one of the first cartels established in California. A collection of lords who were in charge of shipping guilds banded together to dominate the transport of all goods north. Though its ranks have slowly fallen and its stores are running dry, the old guard of the league still holds some influence over Pacific commerce."
 alaskan_solidarity_seattle: "Alaskan Solidarity"
 alaskan_solidarity_seattle_desc: "The Union’s Disorganization during The War of the Mad gave the Alaskans enough courage to invade into Washington. The Reds quickly conquered the region and reorganized it according to Collectivist principles. When order was restored further south, a collection of Union diplomats met with the Alaskans in the city of Seattle to decide the fate of the region. As part of their deal, Alaska would be allowed to keep some of their lands in High Puget and the Olympic Peninsula, but relinquish the rest of their territory in the region. In exchange for allowing the Union to divide their own internal territories how they please among the counts, Alaska was allowed to hold Seattle as a vassal."
 national_goodwill_seattle: "National Goodwill"
 national_goodwill_seattle_desc: "Citizens of Seattle developed a certain reputation among the Californians which was usually described as “Goodwill.” Most people who came from the city would be friendly enough, but more often than not they would keep to themselves. When passions would flare up in the Union congress, the count from Seattle just sat patiently observing, not wanting to cause further conflict. Such a nature came in useful frequently. While other hotheaded counts could not see past their anger, the tepid leaders of Seattle would be able to see compromise."
 dach_legacy_seattle: "Dach Legacy"
 dach_legacy_seattle_desc: "The Kingdom of California was a mighty state which ruled the entirety of the Pacific coast. Its supreme monarch was absolute in his power, yet like most medieval monarchs, needed the support of lords under him to maintain control of his vast realm. Among these lords, the Dachs of Seattle became the most troublesome. Alongside the lords of Espanish, Joaquin, and the brother of the king, the Dachs masterminded the creation of the Union."
 strikers_seattle: "Seattleite Strikers"
 strikers_seattle_desc: "As a member of the Alaskan Collective, Seattle was exempted from the general strike. This allowed the city to covertly take goods from the Alaskans and sell them at a high markup to the other counties around them. It was these actions which initially prompted the Alaskans to tighten their control of the city and eventually outright annex it."
 muckers_seattle: "Muck"
 muckers_seattle_desc: "While under the control of Red Washington, the city of Seattle flourished artistically during the late Classicalist period. A central focus of its cultural development was the spread of “Muck,”  a new style of composition initially introduced by Louvenia Fahey. Its name originates from further south, as the style was hated by nobles of Nevada and Liberty. Fahey’s techniques slowly became the norm throughout the Union and beyond into the rest of the continent."

 cascadian_revolution_washington_minor: "Cascadian Revolution"
 cascadian_revolution_washington_minor_desc: "Starting in the mid 15th century, Washington began to drift away from the rest of the Union due to the conquests of the Tacomans and, eventually, the exodus of the region from the Union with the edict of Vancouver. Its citizens became disconnected with Californian existence and subsequently developed their own identity in spite of all those that surrounded them. These circumstances gave way to the Cascadian Revolution and subsequent founding of the Cascadian Republic."

 ideologically_picky_washington_minor_desc: "While the rest of the American continent was content to hold onto their traditional absolute monarchs, the citizens of Washington and Cascadia were abolishing the position all together. Centuries of freedom baked into the fabric of the Washingtonian identity inevitably caused most plans of Cascadian independence to be republican ones. The resulting democracy had strong individual rights enshrined in its constitution and a legislature so large it would make the Union blush."

 lincolnite_events.3.t: "Tell Em'"
 lincolnite_events.3.d: "Becoming a free city has afforded our nation the ability to finally relax. Under the President’s direct protection from invasion we can turn our eyes to other pursuits. Particular among these is the revival of an ancient tradition of our people: The Bell Festival. In ancient times, when we followed the faith of our brothers in the east, our citizens would gather every year to have their wishes granted by a bell in the center of our town. The vibrations that emanate from its divine brass form would supposedly bend the energy of the worshiper in the direction of their greatest dreams. As we slowly came to adopt the faith of the Constitution, this practice fell out of favor. Despite this, a dedicated family of nobles managed to preserve the bell from all those years ago and have brought it to the capital with the intention of restarting the festival. They assure us that they would take over all the planning and execution, all we would need to do is rouse the city guard. Should we let them go forward with this type of heretical worship?"
 lincolnite_events.3.a: "Ding Ding Ding"

 lincolnite_events.4.d: "Confetti littered the city streets. Every church of [Root.Capital.GetName] rang its bells in a cacophonous symphony. The citizens gathered in the city square, curious of the bronze artifact that stood before them. A small boy, no older than 10, stepped forward in the crowd and put his hand on the cool metallic surface. He glided his fingers over the ancient ridges of the bell. Reaching into his back pocket he pulled out a small baton and, with members of the crowd stepping forward to stop him, struck the side of the bell. A long and deep noise rushed forward from the artifact, seeming to hit each member of the crowd like a wave of bad air. All that surrounded the bell fell to their knees and raised their hands to the sky save for the small boy. The crowded town square grew silent as all eyes fell on him. The boy began to scream. The shrill cry lasted a whole minute, at which point the boy stopped to catch his breath and began again. Another citizen joined him. A few minutes later another joined in the chorus. Slowly, over the course of the afternoon, the entire population of [Root.Capital.GetName] were entranced by the object. Eventually, after the 6th hour of their ritual, the bell began to crack. All through the night they continued to scream, the bell slowly fracturing from their united voice. A few fainted, a few passed, but by the break of day they had advanced the crack to the top of the bell. It slid into two pieces which each fell to the side with an unsatisfying thud. Immediately, most of the crowd fell to the ground, exhausted from their efforts. They wept, gathered the fallen, and returned to their homes. The bell remained."

 string_start_washington: "§MPrimer§!\n\n§YWashington§! serves as the northernmost bulwark of the §YUnion of California§!, a loose collection of different counties united under a §YPresident§!. Less than a decade ago, the whole of the Union was engulfed in a terrible conflict known as §YThe War of the Mad§!. During the war, the §YAlaskan Collectivists§! of the north took advantage of our disorganization and invaded south into Washington. They conquered the region and pushed their misguided beliefs onto many of our countrymen. Eventually, we were liberated from this state of affairs and the region was reorganized into its current political makeup. While we are once again at peace, the Alaskan threat still looms large. With a weak president in §YNapa§! and a lack of unity among the different counties, the future of Washington looks grim. It is our duty to rise up and restore order before it is too late.\n\n§MAncient History§!\n\nLike most of this continent, civilization in Washington was underdeveloped and savage during antiquity. The arrival of §YRussian§! settlers on the west coast first brought order to the wilds. They traded further south with the ancient city states of the §YSouth Bay§! and §YJoaquin§!. Most of the traders took over existing settlements, like Seattle or Olympia and added them to the expanding Russian coastal empire.\n\nSome time before the rise of the §YAmerican Empire§!, the §YYakamans§! conquered all of Washington and ruled over it from their city of §YTahoma§! at the foot of §YRainier§!. Tahoma was a majestic city. Early travelers from further south stated that its beauty was only surpassed by §YSalt Lake City§!. When the Americans first got in contact with the Yakamans they were in the process of claiming the cities of §YPuget§! from the Russians. For most of the empire’s history, their traders bartered with the Yakamans. It is this exchange which is credited for the introduction of viticulture into Washington. An elder of the §YWalla Walla§! band was said to have traveled to the Napa valley and brought back the secrets of their craft. \n\nThe end of the Yakaman rule over Washington came from mother nature itself. The great mountain which stretched over their capital bellowed black smoke and cast hellfire into the city streets. Rainier’s eruption coated most of Tahoma in volcanic rock. The death of most of the §YMamachatpam§! band opened the opportunity for some of the more rebellious elders in the outskirts of the empire to break away. By the 3rd century most traces of the Yakaman empire had collapsed. \n\nOver the next three centuries following the fall of the Yakaman empire, Washington was slowly settled by the Californians. Traders who spent their whole lives carrying goods from further south made their homes in the cities of Puget. So many of these settlers began to set up farms along the Snake river and east Columbia that the lands were officially added to the American empire as the territory of §YLincoln§!. When §YLord Eli§! broke California free from the rest of the American empire, the Lincoln territory joined him. Its extent was expanded to stretch all the way to the western coast, giving the region the shape it holds today.\n\n§MPromises of Union§!\n\nWashington’s existence under the Californian kingdom was mostly unremarkable. The region was split between three different lords of §YHelens§!, §YPuget§!, and §YLincoln§!. Due to the lack of surrounding threats and distance from the capital, most Washingtoninans felt as if they were entitled to a greater level of independence. This was only reinforced by the light touch of the ruling lords who seldom got involved in religious or commercial matters.\n\nUnder this type of free market, a collection of different guilds emerged along the Puget sound. Each of these organizations specialized in the production or transportation of a given good. There was a fishmonger’s guild for the catchers of the region and a fishferrier’s guild for the transport of their catch. The most wealthy of these guilds gathered in the city of Seattle in 621 and combined their organizations to create §YThe Siren League§!.\n\nWhile there were other cartels that emerged during the period, The Siren League was by far the most successful. Over the course of a few decades, the league came to monopolize all aspects of the §YCascadian§! economy. The original captains of the guilds slowly died off and passed on their shares of the league to their children. The §YDach§! family, who originally led the Lumberjack guild, used a series of tactical marriages to amass a controlling share of the company.\n\nThe Siren League’s prosperity was threatened by the growing tyranny from §YSan Francisco§!. In 1083, the king California, §YFabian Norton§!, attempted to curb the power of the Dach family by cutting their realm in half. Out of the western part of the county of Puget, Fabian created the new county of §YOlympia§! and placed a loyal family on the throne. He then demanded that the Dachs split ownership of the Siren league with this new family, but they never responded to this request. Behind the scenes, the Dachs colluded with the lords of §YJoaquin§! and §YToiyabe§! to spell an end to Fabian’s rule. In 1088 Fabian’s brother, §YWestly Norton§!, occupied the capital with his own private army and dissolved the Californian Kingdom.\n\n§MThe Age of Barons§!\n\nPuget and the Dachs took a leading rule in the early Union. The time period from the 11th to 13th centuries is generally referred to as the §YAge of Barons§! in large part due to the actions of their family. The patriarch of the Dach family, §YCasimir Dach§!, used The Siren League’s incredible wealth to bribe electors and guide the course of Union politics. While the Joaquin presidency may have been the face of California for the period, the Dachs were the ones pulling the strings. \n\nThe fall of the Puget state came in 1263 mostly due to infighting in the Dach family. Casimir had 4 sons and 3 daughters who went on to have many children of their own. The problems began with his great great granddaughter §YJaylen Dach§!. Jaylen had made a name for herself fighting in the §YBajan Crusade§! and grew close to the new Francisco president. Her brother,§Y Dameon Dach§!, was placed on the throne despite being only nine years old. With the blessing of the highest office in the land, Jaylen returned to her home and demanded that she be given the throne. When her requests were denied by the advisors of the young king, her soldiers massacred the palace and drowned Dameon in §YLake Washington§!. \n\nJaylen officially dissolved the county of Puget into four different realms of §YHelens§!, §YOlympia§!, §YSeattle§!, and §YWahkiakum§!. She retained her share of the Siren League, but, in the struggle, the organization had voted for the creation of thousands of new shares to be distributed among its members. This diluted her own shares spelled an end to Dachian control of the league. Over the following centuries, the Siren League slowly fell out of power and the Dachs faded into irrelevancy.\n\n§MAlaskan Invasion and Occupation§!\n\n§YThe War of The Mad§! began in 1428 when the President of the Union of California, §YLewis Francisco§!, invaded his own subject of Joaquin and torched the city of Fresno. While the rest of the Union was scrambling to raise up some resistance to his loyal army, most of Washington was split on what actions to take. The majority of the counts saw this as an opportunity for the creation of a new Washingtonian kingdom, but no one could decide on which dynasty would step up and rule such a nation. \n\n§YThe United Alaskan Communes§! had begun their slow creep down the Pacific Coast only 50 years prior with their conquest of the island of §YHaida Gwaii§!. A small revolt in the city of §YBellingham§! by a group of Collectivist workers gave the Alaskans an opportunity to take advantage of Washington’s disorganization. They invaded §YHigh Puge§! and had conquered all the way to Seattle by the winter of 1429. Their campaign in the region continued over the next six months until they finally reached the Columbian river in May of 1430. \n\nAn Alaskan delegation met with President Lewis Francisco in order to sign a peace agreement in August. In return for a guarantee of neutrality in the current civil war, Lewis let the Alaskans hold onto all of the territory they had taken. Under Collectivist rule, Washington was completely reorganized. The old lords and most wealthy artisans were exiled north where they would be redistributed throughout the rest of the Alaskan state. Common citizens were forced to adopt the faith of §YMarx§! and most §YPartisan§! churches were torn down to make way for monuments to the Manifesto’s teachings.\n\n§YThe Redwood Order§! arrived on the other side of the Columbian river in the fall of 1433. War weary and fearful after hearing horror stories of Alaskan devotion, most of the soldiers refused to go any further north. A delegation of Union representatives, mostly made up of §YTraditionalists§!, traveled to the city of Seattle to meet with the Alaskans. They negotiated for the release of territories and a restoration of peace, which the Alaskans eventually granted. §YThe Treaty of Seattle§! officially spelled an end to The War of the Mad. Washington is a beaten region, still reeling from their great losses during the war. Its fate is now in our hands. Will it come to shine above all others on this great continent or fall once again to Red occupation. That story is yours to finish."
