Under the guidance of its local senator, the region was slowly integrated into wider American society.

The complete purge of the city’s Republican revolutionaries left many of the architects of the postwar balance of power without fear of a Sons of Oregon uprising. Throughout the 15th century and into the beginning of the 16th century, certain cells of the Sons of Oregon attempted to influence results of the city’s elections and grow support for their movement among Salem’s citizenry. These actions inevitably led to an intervention by the elector of Willamette and the subsequent annexation of the city."

The city’s major industries were completely destroyed and much of its nobility was slaughtered. Without a means to raise taxes or generate money for the restoration of their city, the citizens of Salem made a formal petition to the new Napan president for direct support. Bluff responded by ensuring that a yearly stipend of their own state’s tax income would be sent north to support the Salemites."

While the rest of the region was still dragging sticks through the mud in the 15th century, Salem grew into one of the most prosperous free cities in the entire Union. The city was often held up as a shining example of what can be achieved by Oregoinians in the aftermath of the disastrous Redwood Campaign."

 willamettes_protection_salem_desc: "The military minds of Salem were befuddled by their quick loss during The Redwood Campaign. The age-old strategy of relying on the natural protection of its surroundings had proven to be inadequate. Medieval armies were far more sophisticated than the various rebel groups it had become accustomed to. In order to ensure that the city never befell the same fate of conquest in the future, its walls were bolstered and expanded into a vast fortress complex. These man-made protections, combined with the work of The Founder, served to protect Salem from foreign occupations for centuries thereafter."

Its paintings elevated the ability of man to triumph over adversity in the wake of absolute carnage. Oregon saw this message in a different light. Most of the arts to come out of the region were darker and more focused on the propensity of society to turn against itself. Many of the pieces produced during this period were lost to time, burned and banned by the authorities for seemingly republican loyalties."

There were attempts to get reparations from the Redwoods for their destruction of the countryside, but nothing materialized. Traditionalists and Progressives went back and forth for years attempting to get any sort of aid for the Oregonians, but every time the talks ended in gridlock.

To prevent this, they began to make the land even more inhospitable to invaders. They destroyed natural springs and built a massive citadel around the city of Burns. Now, only those with the proper wisdom could brave the Highdesert without failing from exhaustion."

The Anarchists, attempting to foster goodwill with who they thought would be easy allies, allowed the Wranglers to stay and linger wherever they pleased. They did not consider that these High Oregonians may have any sort of conviction to their faith, so they were surprised when a force of five thousand Wranglers took over the city of Lovelock."

 string_start_oregon_cult: "§MPrimer§!\n\n§YOregon§! is part of the §YUnion of California§! a loose collection of different counties united under a §YPresident§!. Less than a decade ago, the whole of the Union was engulfed in a terrible conflict known as §YThe War of the Mad§!. During the war, citizens of the region banded together to form the §YRepublic Of Oregon§! and subsequently declared their independence from The Union. Their ill fated coalition was laid low by the §YRedwood Order§! of the south in a devastating campaign. The countryside was leveled and the once prosperous cities of §YAstoria§!, §YEugene§!, §YPortland§!, and §YSalem§! were burnt to ash. Peace was only achieved through the most terrible means, a fact that can be observed in the very spirit of the Oregonian people. Beaten down and weary, they must now contend with a menace that threatens to tear them apart from the inside. A revolutionary group of radicals, holdouts from the days of the Republic, known as the §YSons of Oregon§! have begun a campaign of terror against their own countrymen. With a lack of Presidential support from §YNapa§! and increasing paranoia, it is up to us to take charge and guide the Oregonians to greatness once again.\n\n§MClassical Age§!\n\nDuring ancient times, the lands of Oregon were on the periphery of §YClassical Californian Civilization.§!Traders from the south began to found cities along the coast during their attempts to establish trade routes with §YRussian§! settlers in §YWashington§!. Soon, these city states came to recognize the value of the Oregonian inland tribes, particularly those along the §YWillamette§!, and began trading with them and integrating them into their societies.\n\nOregon became the battleground for a war between the Californian City States and the §YRussian Federation§! as part of §YThe Shallow Wars§!. The eventual southern victory in this conflict led the Californians to place a priority on the lands east of the shore. Hundreds of pioneers settled along the Willamette and slowly Californized the local savages. For a short period, the valley was united under a single state, but family divisions soon tore the region apart. This allowed the §YYakamans§! of Washington to swoop in and subjugate the fractured cities. Oregonians were taxed at an exorbitant high rate, leading many to venture east and make nomadic lives along the §YHighdesert§!.\n\n§YSamson§!, the disciple of §YJesus of the Salt Lake§! who was instructed to corral California, had little interest in Oregon. This fact led the region to stay outside of the §YAmerican Empire§! for most of its existence. Those along the Willamette continued to languish under the rule of the Yakamans. It was only with the eruption of §YRainier§! and the collapse of their empire that the Oregonians were finally granted freedom. \n\nOregon once again fell into the spotlight under the rule of emperor §YNed Philipson§!, who believed that the addition of Oregon, parts of Washington, and §YGreece§! to the §YAmerican Empire§! were vital for its future success. He made Oregon an official province of the empire and placed a loyal Californian bureaucrat in charge of its integration as its senator. This move was widely rebuked by local Oregonians who began a campaign of resistance known as §YThe Whistling§!. Any Californian which walked into an Oregonian dominated town would be met with jeers, whistles, high prices, and occasionally violence. To negotiate a peace, Ned’s successor had the local §YHagenes§! tribe put in charge of the province.\n\nDuring the twilight years of the American Empire, Oregon was focused entirely on the interests of the Hagenes family. When §YLord Eli§! broke California free from the rest of the American empire, the Hagenese resisted and allied themselves with the §YPhillipson§! loyalists in §YUtah§!. Through manipulating the tribes that had languished under Haganes rule, Eli was able to secure support from the Oregonians and include them as a part of the new §YCalifornian Kingdom§!.\n\n§MFamily Feuds§!\n\nAfter a rocky entry to the Californian Kingdom, Oregon was granted special administrative status to keep its respective tribes in line. The region was divided into a series of §Yclans§!, each of which were given control of a few cities. Constant competition between the clans kept Oregon subservient to the king.\n\nCollusion between the lords of §YPuget§!, §YJoaquin§!, and §YToiyabe§!, spelled an end to the Californian Kingdom. In a last bid to reclaim power §YFabian Norton§!, king at the time, marched his armies into Oregon and attempted to rally the local clans to join his cause. They marched south, leaving their northern border open to invasion by the §YDachs§! of Puget. Most clans surrendered before they made it to §YSan Francisco§!. In the aftermath of this attempt, the province of Oregon was broken apart into a series of different independent counts.\n\nThe §YAge of Barons§! was extremely unkind to Oregon. Most of the period saw the local populations subjugated under the thumb of the Dachs. Wars between the different clans were constant due to the meddling of the Washingtonians, often started by those in the north to place the local families in deep debt to the Dachs. §YCasimir Dach§! in particular leveraged his wide family tree to tie together the important clans of Oregon into his own kin. Slowly, over the course of a few centuries, the historic families and clans of Oregon were diluted into irrelevance as the region became one large web of cousins, brothers, and sisters.\n\nOregon emerged from the Age of the Barons into a prosperous golden age. Free from the meddling of the Dachs, the new counts of the region were able to settle their differences and usher in an age of peace. The previously meager cities of Portland, Salem, and Astoria came to rival those of §YLiberty§!. It is during this period that Oregon truly came to be viewed as a central part of the Union. This development eventually fostered into resentment, as an increasingly educated and wealthy class of nobility recognized their lack of influence in the §YElectoral College§!.\n\n§MRepublican Memories§!\n\nUpon the §YPresident’s§! death, member of the §YElectoral College§! vote to determine who will lead the §YUnion of California§!. Oregon, due to its resistance to the Union’s foundation, was not given the electorate. This lack of representation gradually bred animosity between the §YFranciscan Presidency§! and the Oregonians, culminating in a demand for an elector title by the duke of §YWillamette§! in 1357. This request was quickly rejected.\n\nFour years later, a collection of counts met in the city of Salem to discuss a plan to form a §YCaucus§! and argue their position directly in the §YUnion Congress§!. These talks eventually turned towards the idea of a united Oregonian state, one led collectively by the counts in a form of Oligarchy. A representative from the Presidency put an end to this speculation, threatening military intervention and expulsion from the Union if it took place. Despite this, the beginning steps of uniting the region began as the counts created mutual alliances between their states.\n\nThe ascendancy of §YLewis Francisco§! signaled a bright future for a panOregonian state. One of his first speeches before the Union Congress directly called for more autonomy and the growth of “Oregonian Unity.” A collection of the most Pro-Republican counts had an awkward meeting with Lewis in 1426. Clearly already suffering from insanity, Lewis spoke to them through a §YSahaptin§! translator after apparently “forgetting the common tongue.” He expressed complete support for their decision and sent them back north to unite all of Oregon under the republic.\n\nOn the fifth of June, 1428, these counts met in the city of Portland and declared the independence of the §YOregonian Republic§!. Three days later, they declared their official succession from the Union.\n\n§MThe Redwood Campaign§!\n\nInto 1429, the Republic enacted widespread legislative changes that radically reshaped Oregon. Serfdom was abolished and royal coffers were drained to compensate the lords for the loss of their properties. Universal suffrage was extended to all Oregonian citizens. These changes rallied the lesser classes to the republican cause, but led many nobles to flee the east and join with the rising §YKingdom of Echo§!.\n\nThe Republic’s downfall eventually came at the hands of the §YRedwood Order§! and §YNapan Presidency§!. Once Lewis began his crusade through the Joaquin, Oregon sent supplies and volunteers to help him with the campaign. In the summer of 1429, they even signed a formal alliance with the mad president. Oregon’s fate was finally sealed once they invaded into the §YConfederacy of Warmsprings§!,  a state which had refused to join with the republic and remained within the Union. At the famed §YCrescent Delegation§!, the Napan President decided that their resistance force would embark on a campaign of reclamation into Oregon and destroy the republic.\n\n§YRedwood Soldiers§! began their assault in the spring of 1430, starting with the city of Eugene. Disorganized and facing threats from within, the city was quickly lost and the Redwood forces began marching up the Willamette. Each town they conquered faced brutal treatment. The Redwoods were primarily made up of poor rural nobles who had spent their whole lives hearing of the glory achieved by their ancestors in the §YBajan Crusade§!. They greeted the Oregonians as heathens rather than Californian brothers and burned their cities to the ground. The earth was salted, entire vineyards plundered, and the once beautiful cities of the Willamette crumbled into ash.\n\nRepublican leadership slowly collapsed. The loss of Portland saw the majority of forces retreat east to Bend. A final surrender by the acting President came when the lord of Bend betrayed those who sought refuge in his city by opening the gates to the Redwoods. Despite the official end to the war, the most radical members of the former republic continue to persist as members of the covert §YSons of Oregon§!. Throughout the mid 1400s they have waged a campaign of terror against nobles and citizens of the region that are loyal to the new Napan regime. The Oregonians are a beaten people. Their cities lie in ruin, their countryside is a mess, and an entire generation of widows and widowers grieve the loss of their partners. Its fate is now in our hands. Will Oregon come to once again reclaim its former glory or remain defeated and fade into irrelevant. That story is yours to finish."

Constant competition between the clans kept Oregon subservient to the king.\n\nCollusion between the lords of §YPuget§!, §YJoaquin§!, and §YToiyabe§!, spelled an end to the Californian Kingdom. In a last bid to reclaim power §YFabian Norton§!, king at the time, marched his armies into Oregon and attempted to rally the local clans to join his cause. They marched south, leaving their northern border open to invasion by the §YDachs§! of Puget. Most clans surrendered before they made it to §YSan Francisco§!. In the aftermath of this attempt, the province of Oregon was broken apart into a series of different independent counts.\n\nThe §YAge of Barons§! was extremely unkind to Oregon. Most of the period saw the local populations subjugated under the thumb of the Dachs. Wars between the different clans were constant due to the meddling of the Washingtonians, often started by those in the north to place the local families in deep debt to the Dachs. §YCasimir Dach§! in particular leveraged his wide family tree to tie together the important clans of Oregon into his own kin. Slowly, over the course of a few centuries, the historic families and clans of Oregon were diluted into irrelevance as the region became one large web of cousins, brothers, and sisters.\n\nOregon emerged from the Age of the Barons into a prosperous golden age. Free from the meddling of the Dachs, the new counts of the region were able to settle their differences and usher in an age of peace. The previously meager cities of Portland, Salem, and Astoria came to rival those of §YLiberty§!. It is during this period that Oregon truly came to be viewed as a central part of the Union. This development eventually fostered into resentment, as an increasingly educated and wealthy class of nobility recognized their lack of influence in the §YElectoral College§!.\n\n§MRepublican Memories§!\n\nUpon the §YPresident’s§! death, member of the §YElectoral College§! vote to determine who will lead the §YUnion of California§!. Oregon, due to its resistance to the Union’s foundation, was not given the electorate. This lack of representation gradually bred animosity between the §YFranciscan Presidency§! and the Oregonians, culminating in a demand for an elector title by the duke of §YWillamette§! in 1357. This request was quickly rejected.\n\nFour years later, a collection of counts met in the city of Salem to discuss a plan to form a §YCaucus§! and argue their position directly in the §YUnion Congress§!. These talks eventually turned towards the idea of a united Oregonian state, one led collectively by the counts in a form of Oligarchy. A representative from the Presidency put an end to this speculation, threatening military intervention and expulsion from the Union if it took place. Despite this, the beginning steps of uniting the region began as the counts created mutual alliances between their states.\n\nThe ascendancy of §YLewis Francisco§! signaled a bright future for a panOregonian state. One of his first speeches before the Union Congress directly called for more autonomy and the growth of “Oregonian Unity.” A collection of the most Pro-Republican counts had an awkward meeting with Lewis in 1426. Clearly already suffering from insanity, Lewis spoke to them through a §YSahaptin§! translator after apparently “forgetting the common tongue.” He expressed complete support for their decision and sent them back north to unite all of Oregon under the republic.\n\nOn the fifth of June, 1428, these counts met in the city of Portland and declared the independence of the §YOregonian Republic§!. Three days later, they declared their official succession from the Union.\n\n§MThe Redwood Campaign§!\n\nInto 1429, the Republic enacted widespread legislative changes that radically reshaped Oregon. Serfdom was abolished and royal coffers were drained to compensate the lords for the loss of their properties. Universal suffrage was extended to all Oregonian citizens. These changes rallied the lesser classes to the republican cause, but led many nobles to flee the east and join with the rising §YKingdom of Echo§!.\n\nThe Republic’s downfall eventually came at the hands of the §YRedwood Order§! and §YNapan Presidency§!. Once Lewis began his crusade through the Joaquin, Oregon sent supplies and volunteers to help him with the campaign. In the summer of 1429, they even signed a formal alliance with the mad president. Oregon’s fate was finally sealed once they invaded into the §YConfederacy of Warmsprings§!,  a state which had refused to join with the republic and remained within the Union. At the famed §YCrescent Delegation§!, the Napan President decided that their resistance force would embark on a campaign of reclamation into Oregon and destroy the republic.\n\n§YRedwood Soldiers§! began their assault in the spring of 1430, starting with the city of Eugene. Disorganized and facing threats from within, the city was quickly lost and the Redwood forces began marching up the Willamette. Each town they conquered faced brutal treatment. The Redwoods were primarily made up of poor rural nobles who had spent their whole lives hearing of the glory achieved by their ancestors in the §YBajan Crusade§!. They greeted the Oregonians as heathens rather than Californian brothers and burned their cities to the ground. The earth was salted, entire vineyards plundered, and the once beautiful cities of the Willamette crumbled into ash.\n\nRepublican leadership slowly collapsed. The loss of Portland saw the majority of forces retreat east to Bend. A final surrender by the acting President came when the lord of Bend betrayed those who sought refuge in his city by opening the gates to the Redwoods. Despite the official end to the war, the most radical members of the former republic continue to persist as members of the covert §YSons of Oregon§!. Throughout the mid 1400s they have waged a campaign of terror against nobles and citizens of the region that are loyal to the new Napan regime. The Oregonians are a beaten people. Their cities lie in ruin, their countryside is a mess, and an entire generation of widows and widowers grieve the loss of their partners. Its fate is now in our hands. Will Oregon come to once again reclaim its former glory or remain defeated and fade into irrelevant. That story is yours to finish."
