 bolstered_authenticity_skagit: "Bolstered Authenticity"
 bolstered_authenticity_skagit_desc: "While our brothers and sisters of the plains in the east have their rule legitimized by the stars, we can point to the president down south as a reason why we should be in charge. Our great Counsel’s rule should never be questioned, for it is the will of The Founder and the citizens that they serve."
 council_of_the_snohomish_skagit: "Council of the Snohomish"
 council_of_the_snohomish_skagit_desc: "Our great republic was founded only a few decades before the Union went downhill. Out of the dying Kingdom of Idaho, a collection of nobles from Snohomish rebelled against their lord in Colville and formed The Snohomish Council. They ventured to San Francisco to plead for entry into the Union. By The Founder’s grace, their request was accepted and the county of Skagit was created."
 theanite_talent_sink_skagit: "Theanite Talent Sink"
 theanite_talent_sink_skagit_desc: "The former territories of Idaho are cruel and barren. Constant rebellion and famine scar the land. Many of the richest members of the former kingdom traveled west to our home. They settled down and worked to protect us from those in Idaho who wished to disrupt our peace."
 the_consitutions_embrace_skagit: "The Constitution's Embrace"
 the_consitutions_embrace_skagit_desc: "In exchange for entry into the Union, The Snohomish Council converted to the Partisan faith. Though some have been resistant to The Founder’s words, many of the former Theanites have traded in their Bibles for the Constitution. Theanism required so much work to keep the Heavenly Mother appeased. Practitioners would need to spend hours energy bending, diffusing oils, and meditating over crystals. It's nice to have a God that doesn’t need as much pampering."
 union_powwows_skagit: "Union Powwows"
 union_powwows_skagit_desc: "Though many of the Trueheir counts were outraged at the practice, Skagit frequently hosted “Union Powwows” to help tie their people closer to the Californians. These affairs offered the average Californian noble the opportunity to get their hands dirty and sleep under the open stars. As time went on, the Powwows grew and eventually became crucial political events. Deals crafted in the woods would go on to impact generations of Union citizens."
 claim_throne_of_idaho_skagit: "Claim Throne of Idaho"
 claim_throne_of_idaho_skagit_desc: "Many within our borders still long for the days of Idaho. Beneath the King’s gentle reign, harvests were grand and our lives were simpler. Now we have to contend with Union politics and republican infighting. It is our duty to bring back this golden period. Ready the men and march east!"
 skagit_valley_tulips_skagit: "Skagit Valley Tulips"
 skagit_valley_tulips_skagit_desc: "Many members of the Snohomish Council gained notoriety under the Idaho Kingdom for their management of the tulip market. Snohomish tulips are prized for their noteworthy color and deep pigmentation. The flowers were lusted after by nobles of Idaho for this reason and often fetched high prices. Under our rule, the tulip fields will no doubt be more bountiful than ever."

 lincolnite_ideas: "Lincolnite Ideas"
 lincolnite_inland_empire: "Inland Empire"
 lincolnite_inland_empire_desc: "The lands east of the Cascades and west of Idaho are known to the Californians as the “Inland Empire.” This lofty title comes from the area’s rich soil and abundance of farms. These benefits, alongside the Inland Empire’s flat terrain, makes it the perfect place to establish populous cities. Trade in the region is mostly guided along the Columbia and Snake rivers, allowing for goods to travel west and be transported along the pacific coast."
 lincolnite_spokane_complex: "Spokane Complex"
 lincolnite_spokane_complex_desc: "Due to rising tensions between the Union and Idaho Kingdom, the lord of Spokane vastly expanded the city’s castle in order to better protect his realm. Through the work of the most talented architects and military strategists of the day, the so-called “Spokane Complex” came to be one of the most efficient training grounds for young soldiers on the American continent. Upon hearing of its construction, the King of Idaho sent his own son to the city to learn under the guidance of the Complex’s wise tutors."
 lincolnite_columbia_farming: "Columbia Farming"
 lincolnite_columbia_farming_desc: "To provide for the populous cities of the Idaho kingdom, and later the towns of Puget, the farmlands of Lincoln were carved up and divided among the most loyal lords. Serfs from Roosevelt, Kiikiwaahk, and even as far as Dakota forcibly moved west to work these lands. From their labor, the countryside was reshaped to feed the masses of Boise, Seattle, and Portland."
 lincolnite_the_indie_system: "The Indie System"
 lincolnite_the_indie_system_desc: "The short-lived Lincolnite county gave the Theanites under their rule a special status. Those that did not follow the faith of the Founder were required to pay hefty fines and were barred from owning land. All of the former Theanite lords had their holdings taken from them, most of which were sold back to them at a higher price once they had converted to the true faith. This “Indie System” quickly filled the royal coffers and allowed the county to make many expensive purchases, many of which it never finished paying."
 lincolnite_lincolnite_captains: "Lincolnite Captains"
 lincolnite_lincolnite_captains_desc: "Life east of the Cascades required a kind of grit rarely seen among the pampered elites of the south. The generation of successful Lincolnite lords who came up under Red Washingtonian rule were famed for their ability on the battlefield. During the Anarchist Wars in Nevada, these Lincolnite captains were among the few trained military officers who fought on the side of the mob."
 lincolnite_call_to_arms: "Call to Arms"
 lincolnite_call_to_arms_desc: "Tired of farming and wanting to spread Collectivist ideals across the globe, many of the young citizens of Lincoln fled their Communes during the 17th century to fight for glory in foreign lands. In almost every conflict of the period on the American continent, at least one soldier came from the plains we called home."
 lincolnite_freedom_fighters: "Freedom Fighters"
 lincolnite_freedom_fighters_desc: "The grizzled and war hardened Lincolnites that returned home after their foreign campaigns used their newfound skills to help secure an independent future for Washington. The Cascadian Revolution was masterminded by expert Lincolnite tacticians. Their successive victories were built on the lessons learned from Ontario to Florida. "

 serving_the_suits_skagit_desc: "Redoubling our obligations to the union means that we have to show the President and Electors that we deserve a place alongside them at the table. The lands that we conquer should be organized under the Union, so that if our rule fails and they rebel, the resulting counts will be under the emperor’s guidance as well."

 striking_at_the_elector_skagit_desc: "For Washington to be whole we must eliminate all other nations which could be seen as holding a more legitimate claim to the title. Any count who holds the title of elector will be seen as the natural choice for leading Washington in the eyes of the president. We must relieve the Elector of Vancouver of their post so that we may continue in our plan to unite Washington."
 the_bay_of_willapa_skagit_title: "The Bay of Willapa"
 the_bay_of_willapa_skagit_desc: "While our nation has never been navally inclined, we will need to have some sort of fleet if we wish to maintain sovereignty along the pacific coast. To build a fleet we need a port and robust shipbuilders. For this task, the city Wahkiakum along Willapa bay will serve perfectly. Its expanded docks and rich maritime tradition will no doubt make the task of creating a coastal presence much easier."
 president_or_chief_skagit_title: "President or Chief"
 president_or_chief_skagit_desc: "Our nation lies on a precipice, either side of which could very well lead to our doom. Though we survived their initial invasion, the continued Alaskan presence in Washington has sparked fears that our nation may face subjugation. On the other hand, the Union is still unstable after The War of the Mad. The new president seems weak and is giving way to Traditionalist domination. We must decide if it is time to cozy closer to the Napans or go our own way."

 encourage_migration_skagit_desc: "An easy way to bolster our county’s population and infrastructure is to allow others to improve it for us. If we develop our lands and extend an offer to the lesser lords of Puget to make their home in our county, many will no doubt pack up their bags and head to Snoqualmie. "
 californication_skagit_title: "Californication"
 californication_skagit_desc: "Though we are still connected to the culture of our Metis ancestors, it is undeniable that the arrival of the Pugetites has had a cultural impact on our state. Our citizens have adopted aspects of both ways of life and formed their own hybrid of the two. Some have put a label on the new practice, calling themselves Lincolnite."

 channel_to_the_sea_skagit_desc: "When the Alaskans invaded Puget, they left our lands alone. For some reason, they believed our territory was not worth the hassle of conquest. Our independence was secured in the Treaty of Clark when the Alaskans signed a peace with the Mad President Lewis. While we have held warm relations with the communes due to this respect, if we are to unite Washington we will need to excise them from the region."
 flowers_of_snohomish_skagit_title: "Flowers of Snohomish"
 flowers_of_snohomish_skagit_desc: "While our tulips always sold well among the nobles of Idaho, it seems that the wealthy of the Union do not care much about their beauty. To nudge the market in the right direction, we should do a bit of advertising, invest in the farms, and create a central market where all can gather to buy the product."

 tulip_mania_skagit_desc: "The nobles are going crazy for our tulips! While we could simply find a rhythm in our current production and continue to rake in profits, we might be able to earn more if we artificially limit the supply. As the sole source of tulips in the empire we could exploit this demand and drive up the price to an unprecedented high."

 challenge_colville_skagit_desc: "Our county was born out of Colville. We fought alongside their generals in a bloody conflict to win Washingtonian independence from the Kingdom of Idaho, yet when the task of administration began it seemed we had traded one tyrant for another. The Snohomish council assembled and lobbied to the president of the Union to give our people what they truly wanted: a republic. "

 skagit_events.1.t: "Come To The East!"
 skagit_events.1.d: "If we want to grow our cities quickly, it might be easier to invite lesser nobles from the west to join our ranks rather than investing heavily ourselves. After making sure that our realm is up to the caliber these nobles are used to, it is time to finally put out the call for them to come over. News of our plan has already leaked and, while we are excited to welcome many of the nobles to our county, some rich merchants and artisans have also requested that we give them land to call their own. Giving up even more of our count’s territory was not part of the plan, but might be worth it in the long run as these eager souls improve their own turf."

The exodus of these weak minded fools has led many misguided citizens to follow them. Now that they are under the protection of those snakes in the east there's nothing we can do to get them back."
