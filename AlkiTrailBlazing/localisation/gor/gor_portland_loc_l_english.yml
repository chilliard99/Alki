 the_founders_mission_portland: "The Founder's Mission"
 the_founders_mission_portland_desc: "The Constitution is clear about the status of man in this world. We were meant to be free among the animals, guided by the Spirit of Liberty to live among the wilds. Instead, we have fallen to sin. We have carved up The Founder’s creation into cities and civilization. It is up to us to restore the world to its natural state."
 heretic_pyres_portland: "Heretic Pyres"
 heretic_pyres_portland_desc: "Man has come to outnumber the birds. The many hungry mouths of civilization have populated the girth of the natural world from the garden of eden to the edge of the Earth. All those that continue to exist in this mode of endless production are against us and should be branded as heretics. Removing their destructive sort from our society will not be enough. We must make an example out of them, so that all of those that wish to taint this world come to fear Mother Nature. Send the men of each village to the woods. Tell them to make a day of gathering timber for a great fire. The heretics will be scattered across the skies."
 barbaric_methods_portland: "Barbaric Methods"
 barbaric_methods_portland_desc: "We have gained notoriety for our methods of warfare. Since we have no regard for civility of any sort, our soldiers are free to tear down and pillage all manner of man made structures. They have been specially taught how to live off the land from their excellent commanders. The Redwood Campaign taught us how we can weaponize our lack of inhibitions to dominate our enemy. May the wisdom we have gained from that horrid affair serve us well into the future."
 protect_nature_portland: "Protect Nature"
 protect_nature_portland_desc: "Our neighbors look at us with terrified eyes. They are right to be afraid. Their civilization is no match for the wrath of nature. We have no doubt that they will take the first opportunity available to shut us down. Their soft armies will march into the forest and face the wrath of those that live within. They are not ready for the might of a cunning predator in its natural environment."
 civilizations_weeds_portland: "Civilization's Weeds"
 civilizations_weeds_portland_desc: "The end of society will not come immediately. It must be a gradual process as to let those within become adjusted to their return to savagery. Once they gain a taste of the freedom available outside of the laws of man there will be no stopping them from tearing down the manors, farmlands, and dockyards. The more dogmatic among them will require guidance. Luckily, we are here to temper their passions and usher in a new global age of peace."
 natures_guidance_portland: "Nature's Guidance"
 natures_guidance_portland_desc: "The explicit Constitutional justification for Naturalism is based in the tale of creation. The Founder built this world and all those within. He set aside a portion of it for man to think and build upon, but dedicated the rest to the trees and birds. The scholars of the south interpret this to be the lands of California, but we know that the lands of man lied only in the Garden of Eden. The dirt we stand on is protected by the almighty. To live alongside him with our own vine and fig tree, we must do our best to live according to his will and remove the taint of civilization from these hallowed grounds."
 bane_of_man_portland: "Bane of Man"
 bane_of_man_portland_desc: "We must not confine our restoration of nature to our own borders. The concept of nations and territory is a manmade one. All truly lies under the reign of the almighty. We must convince our neighbors of their sin and invite them to join our fold. The ensuing task will not be easy. That forbidden fruit has hooked its roots into the souls of so many of our fellow Californians. Some are beyond redemption. It is our duty as liberators to excise the demons of society and let the natural world recover."

It is led by a Senator who is chosen by a council of pious clergymen to represent the will of The Founder."

 naturalists_fervor_desc: "Naturalist Fervor represents the dissatisfaction with the current level of civilization in your nation among the citizenry. Once it reaches 100, our civilians will rise up and tear down the manmade world. As Naturalist Fervor increases our soldiers will fight with unbridled savagery to bring more of The Founder’s creation under our reign.

We must garner a more global presence. Those that wish to defile The Founder’s great creation will fear the stories of our mighty armies. When we arrive at their borders, the tales of our savagery will no doubt cause their men to surrender and give in to Mother Nature."

 shoalwater_estuary_portland_desc: "Willapa Bay was once a monument to the beauty of Washington, but its mayor has gone down the path of the Pugetites and attempts to wage war against the mighty sea. Day after day, his seaman wrangle the tides in an attempt to keep their precious docks from falling under the waves. This slavery cannot be allowed to continue, we must march north and free the bay so that it can flow free once again."
 crumbling_puget_portland_title: "Crumbling Puget"
 crumbling_puget_portland_desc: "There is no greater monument to the destructive nature of man in the north than the cities of Puget. Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, and Everett poison the land with their very existence. The citizens within have been made fat and lazy. Not a single among them could catch a wild doe or even throw a spear a measly twelve paces. We must tear down their cushy roads and houses. The dirt between their toes will hopefully bring out their ancestor’s wisdom."

In the east, the wide plains of the Inland Empire are home to the beautiful species of Pend Oreielle and the majesty of Palouse Falls. The Brave Cascades divide it all, stretching up into the heavens and watching over the rest of the land. Such majesty has been forever tarnished by the stink of civilization. Perhaps one day, through a concentrated effort on our part, it can be returned to its original state once again."

 conservation_efforts_portland_desc: "At the dawn of time, The Founder liberated light from dark and breathed life into this cold rock. He set aside Earth for the animals and trees. For his most beloved creation, man, he constructed a paradise known as Eden. In the garden of Eden our ancient father and mother lived free from fear and want. Their hubris, their single sin, cast us out of Eden and relegated us to live among the animals. In their arrogance, man has attempted to restore the bliss of Eden through his own works. Such monuments erode The Founder’s creation. It is our duty to take control of the state and preserve the natural world as soon as possible."

 preemptive_destruction_portland_desc: "Removing the taint of creation is a difficult task, one that fills the majority of our days. To make its process easier some of our advisors have suggested that we train our soldiers in the art of restoration. Given that they will already be conquering the territories, our soldiers will be in the perfect position to tear down important cities and markers of man.

To this end we cannot have our state governed by any corruptible sort. Under their influence our plans will be neutered or rejected all together. We must put all of our support in the Climatist and trust in The Founder’s judgment."
 slash_and_burn_portland_title: "Slash And Burn"
 slash_and_burn_portland_desc: "With the discovery of the New World and the increasing greed of man, it seems the road ahead has become much rockier. There is no doubt in our mind that humanity will continue to infect The Founder’s world like a plague. The roots of their wretched civilization will dig themselves so deep as to make them impossible to remove. If they wish to hide away deep beneath the Earth: fine. We will burn their homes and salt their fields. We will slash their throats and cleanse their works in a holy fire. When it is all over, and the mountains of man no longer molest the skyline, we will forge something beautiful."

 nearshore_portland_desc: "Elmer Quitituit, once a fateful ally of our order, has turned his back on The Founder. We saw his actions at Newport and Tillamook and recognized his disdain for civilization. However, when we offered him a place as the leader of our order, he demanded that we transfer all power to him. We know now that he is not wise to The Founder’s promise, nor would knowledge of civilization’s evils even matter to him. He is yet another power hungry rat that must be dealt with."
 columbian_front_portland_title: "Columbian Front"
 columbian_front_portland_desc: "The traditional “sister” city to our capital of Portland lies north in Washington. Vancouver sits right on the other side of the Columbia river, a fact which has continuously provided problems for our efforts to destroy the works of man. All those who have been blinded by civilization’s corrupting influence flee north to Vancouver. We have lost many talented scholars and workers who could have aided us in our goals. Let us make it a mission to get them back. What are they gonna do, run even further north? "

 rush_past_shasta_portland_desc: "The mountains of Jefferson are already sparsely populated. To ensure that we can complete our naturalization of the region in a timely manner it might be prudent for us to march past the Shastas and focus more on the developed lowlands of northern Sacramento. This way, the entire region will be returned to nature around the same time instead of remaining uneven with large patches of civilization."
 luddite_core_portland_title: "Luddite Core"
 luddite_core_portland_desc: "Vital to our success in carrying out The Founder’s will is having the support of our citizenry. Perhaps the easiest way to do this is to involve them in governance. They need to be truly inspired to serve. Allow them to engage in the catharsis of destruction. Give every man, woman, and child a nice firm hammer and let them crush their own homes. Those that have a knack for it can join our ranks and serve our higher purpose."

We do not endeavor to create a state of utter savagery, far from it. We intend to live by the laws of The Founder on this borrowed land. We must make this clear now. As we head further into primitivism such attempts to reign in power will only become more difficult."

We assisted The Redwoods in their conquest of Portland by having the will to do what they could not. We leveled the countryside, murdered the Astors, and proclaimed an end to the republic. We thought that we would then join arms with the mighty Redwoods and return all of The Founder’s world to its natural state, but it turns out those Jeffersonians were not as righteous as they led us to believe. We are surrounded by the stink of civilization. Ready the men and light the torches, nature begs for release."

Let us show them what truly pure souls can accomplish when given The Founder’s blessing."

 klamaths_return_portland_desc: "Our ideology is not a new one. In ancient times a group of pioneers dissatisfied with the Ursan restrictions made their home along the Klamath river. They were free and happy among the wilds. Back then, there were no roads or towns, so each family lived in their own humble woodland homes. We have always been jealous of this freedom.

We fought alongside the Republicans against the Traditionalist forces before The War of The Mad with the promise that we could live out primitive lives in the east. Such dreams were crushed with the arrival of the Redwoods. The Green Thumbs have long remained dormant in our state. Their once expert martial prowess has been reduced to a memory. To protect nature and prevent rebellion we ought to reestablish The Green Thumbs and use their wisdom to spread The Founder’s influence far and wide."

If we do not drastically reduce the world’s population, or get them to take shorter breaths, we will all drown in open fields. Such dire circumstances will require an equally brutal solution. Gather the most talented of our soldiers and tell them of this fate. They must rise to the occasion and do the unthinkable to ensure that future generations can enjoy the sweet summer air."

The Willamette valley sits just east of the Nearshore and used to be a hub of civilization before our interference. Of course, you then have the Cascades and the boonies of Morrow and Crook. Beyond all of this lies the famed Highdesert, a great plain of nothingness that borders Idaho and Nevada. Such territories are perfect for our goals.

 portland_events.1.d: "The more zealous among our population have finally taken nature’s return into their own hands. For years they have languished under civilization’s oppression. The cities that littered our countryside served as a monument to the failure of humanity to live in harmony with The Founder’s creation. Passions flared across our nation as those that were fed up with these monuments did something about them. Brick by brick, the mountains of man were destroyed and returned to rubble. In their absence flowers bloom and the creatures of the woods return to their rightful homes. While the rest of the world continues to suffer under a slavery of their own creation, we can finally take a moment and enjoy the freedom of primitivity."

The promise of freedom for the individual is one of the major parts of The Founder’s message. However, with this great freedom it is likely that humanity will once again return to its state of civilization. Such a terrible fate would no doubt leave us in the same position we found ourselves in before. To prevent this from coming to pass, some of our closest advisors have suggested that we concentrate power in the hands of a few trusted individuals who have the support of the army. This way, should the worst come to pass, our trusted soldiers can tear down the vestiges of civilization and return us to noble savagery. This type of power grab, done for any greedy purpose, would no doubt be seen by our people as something utterly tyrannical. However, given our past track record of liberation and devotion to The Founder’s mission, we have no doubt that our civilians will see the nobility of our intention and trust our judgment. The ultimate question is not of their support, but that of The Founder above. Let us decide on a path forward which elevates him first and foremost."

The Naturalists are hellbent on tearing down all man made structures and ushering in an age of primitivism. They wish for mankind to live among the creatures like our ancient ancestors. Given their disdain for civilization, these Naturalists have no qualms about using brutal tactics. They will burn, pillage, and violate every civil law to destroy our resolve.

 portland_events.4.d: "We have done what our ancestors could only have dreamed of. Through The Founder’s blessing and copious bloodshed, we have united most of California in a state of primitive bliss. What remains is a loose coalition of various communities united across the barren Earth. We have ushered in The Founder’s vision and brought a beautiful return to nature. Yet, many among our state have said that we have not gone far enough. The power hungry dogs that surround us will not stop until we have accepted their shameful “civility.” Some have begun to argue that we must continue our march east and unite the rest of this great world under our reign.
