 willamette_wines_willamette: "Willamette Wines"
 willamette_wines_willamette_desc: "Wine is among the most prominent of California’s exports. During the Classicalist Revival, Californian wine was romanticized as part of the returning aesthetic of antiquity. The two largest regions of wine production are the Willamette and Napan vitrias. The former of these currently lies under our rule. While production has fallen greatly from its pre-Redwood Invasion height, the notoriety of our special red continues to spread Oregonian influence abroad and fill our coffers."
 house_of_duck_willamette: "House of Duck"
 house_of_duck_willamette_desc: "The House of Duck was a relatively unknown family before their ascension to the electorship in the aftermath of the Redwood invasion. Before The War of The Mad, they held territory in Eugene. Their family was best known for their inoffensive status. The Ducks were typically mediators whose lack of strong conviction allowed them to tie together competing interests. In the aftermath of the Republic, they were seen as the best choice for the electorate by Traditionalists and Progressives alike for this quality."
 left_standing_willamette: "Left Standing"
 left_standing_willamette_desc: "Eugene was spared the worst of the Redwood Invasion. The city was only partially defended as the majority of Republican forces fled north to protect Portland and Salem. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the new Napan president sent a force of 100 able bodied builders and architects to help restore Eugene. These brave souls worked tirelessly to rebuild the city, a task which would take until 1453 to complete. Even in its partially ruined state, Eugene quickly eclipsed Portland and Salem as the center of Oregonian commerce and political influence."
 cobblers_company_willamette: "Cobbler's Company"
 cobblers_company_willamette_desc: "The Redwood Invasion is full of interesting tales from the soldiers within. Perhaps one of the most common is that of the Cobbler’s Company of Roseburg. Their crew was primarily made up of old men, street cobblers from Roseburg who raised their arms to retake Oregon. They helped to guide some of the younger and more hotheaded soldiers in their conquest of the Willamette. It was their hesitation that prevented the utter destruction of the cities of Corvallis and Albany. Their legacy can be seen in the center of Eugene’s town square, where a statue devoted to the humble Cobbler’s Company stands proud above the citizenry."
 representing_oregon_willamette: "Representing Oregon"
 representing_oregon_willamette_desc: "Willamette bears a heavy responsibility in representing Oregon in the rest of the Union. They must ensure that the region is able to recover from its destruction years earlier while at the same time preventing the Sons of Oregon from causing too much damage. Without much support from the President, Oregonians now turn their eyes to their local elector. Will they rise to meet the challenges of rule or falter and let another take their place?"
 revolutionaries_in_government_willamette: "Revolutionaries In Government"
 revolutionaries_in_government_willamette_desc: "The Willamette approach to dealing with the Sons of Oregon was unique among its surrounding states. While most counties used their soldiers to root out these revolutionaries and slaughter them, the wise elector gradually introduced them into the government. Once some of their members got the taste of power, they were more than willing to meld into the union-positive sentiments of the administration and abandon their more radical beliefs."
 unite_the_river_willamette: "Unite The River"
 unite_the_river_willamette_desc: "Our nation must confirm its namesake by conquering the rest of the Willamette river. We were destined to hold all of it under our control, but our ambitions were prematurely silenced with the independence of Salem and Portland. The damned Napan president thought that if we were given too much power our state would fall to the influence of those shadowy Sons of Oregon. Wake the men and rally the horses, let us show those Napans that we are made of stronger stuff."

 eugene_restoration_willamette_desc: "The first goal of our rule should be to finish the restoration of our capital Eugene. The city was hit hard by the Redwood invaders, having most of its population slaughtered and local farmlands pillaged. While our citizenry has managed to repopulate the city streets, there are still some sections near the borders of the province that lie in ruin. A few extra ducats and a little bit of elbow grease should put us back to where we were before The War of The Mad."

If we want anything to get done, we must force the issue on them.

It took the total independence of the region and a subsequent brutal war to even get a seat at the table. If we ever wish to be taken seriously we must garner support for the highest office in the land. Reach out to the electors who are sympathetic to our plight and tell them of our intentions.

These devoted rebels are loyalists to the old Oregonian Republic who have made it their mission to restore the former state. While there used to be some level heads among their bunch, they have all been ousted in exchange for the most radical of thought.

This is to say that there is no problem with the creation of a strong Oreognian state, simply a flawed execution. We now stand at the precipice of succeeding where they have failed.

 willamette_events.2.t: "The Shadow War"
 willamette_events.2.d: "The Oregonian Republic had a wide diversity of thought. Despite this, most of the state’s higher ups were moderate and simply wanted to leave the Union and create a republic outside of the influence of the Presidency. The Redwood Campaign changed all of this. Most major leaders either fled east into the plains or were slaughtered during the purge of Portland. What remained were a collection of the most radical elements of the Oregonian Republican movement. This group named themselves the Sons of Oregon and have consistently proved to be a nuisance for the region ever since. The Sons of Oregon have brutal tactics that focus on assassinating major political figures, razing the countryside, and infiltrating the halls of government. While we have attempted to keep their movement silent and attacked them from the shadows, their abilities are proving to be too much to handle. Continuing down this covert route to clamping down on their operations will only lead to further headaches. We need something more permanent. As we see it there are only two real paths forward: Absolution or Destruction. The former would involve gradually introducing the Sons of Oregon into our government until they were completely integrated. While this way would probably be bloodless, it might open us to takeover from those that remain loyal. Alternatively we could declare an open war against the Sons of Oregon and publically purge them from all aspects of our state. This would likely lead to great public outcry and potentially even inspire more to join their cause, but by the time it was over the movement would have no ground to stand on. Whatever option we chose will no doubt be far more effective than our current strategy."

They would prefer that this whole region be returned to the chaos of Republicanism instead of its current status. These types of thoughts cannot be allowed to foster in government.

We torched their houses. We slaughtered whole families. We cleaned the countryside until no taint of their order remained. The deed is done.

The army marched into [Root.Capital.GetName] and unfurled the banner of their new order. The rest of their seedy sort have crawled out of the woodwork and taken high offices in the state.

With such an audience, we were finally able to call for the dedication of funds to restore Oregonian cities. The political power of our supporting caucus made this an impossible plea to refuse.

Such an action was accepted by the Mad President Lewis Francisco, but roundly rejected by all other nations in the Union. As part of The Great Resistance, the Redwood Order invaded north into Oregon in a brutal conquest known as the Redwood Campaign. They reduced much of the region’s cities to ash and slaughtered its main leadership. With the support of an influential caucus, [From.GetName] has now approached us and demanded funds to rebuild their cities. Such funds would be distributed among all Oregonian nations. We will have to accept, lest we face dire political consequences, the question is where we'll draw the funds from. We can either reach into our own coffers or take a tax from the Union Congress."

While we wouldn’t normally be concerned about such rabble, it seems that the message is beginning to take off.

 willamette_events.11.d: "Before The War of the Mad, the Union was mostly dominated by a single Progressive Unionwide order. The Francisco Presidency ensured that only Progressive nations would hold power within the Union congress and that Progressives alone would represent the Californians abroad. The War of the Mad changed all this. The Traditionalists struck a deal with the Utahns and greatly expanded their political power by coordinating the reconquest of Joaquin and Oregon. The Traditionalists were the architects of the new Union. The President may be Progressive, but it is the Traditionalists who run the Congress. This environment has made it prohibitively difficult to claim the presidency. Our nation has traditionally straddled the line between these two parties, a fact which earned us the electorate in the first place. If we were to switch sides at this point, it is unlikely that it would come as a surprise to many. May the Spirit of Liberty protect us on whatever path we take."
