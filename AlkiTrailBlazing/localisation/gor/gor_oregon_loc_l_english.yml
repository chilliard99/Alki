 oregon_ideas: "Oregon Ideas"
 brothers_reunited_oregon: "Brothers Reunited"
 brothers_reunited_oregon_desc: "Though it was not officially accepted by the rest of the Union, the old Oregonian Republic is still remembered fondly among our people. Less for its rejection of the Presidency, but more for its status as a nexus for the Oregonian people. Under the Republic’s banner we were finally free from the divisions of petty borders. Once again we have been liberated from these constraints, finally united and ready to face the world’s challenges."
 columbian_arms_oregon: "Columbian Arms"
 columbian_arms_oregon_desc: "Among our citizenry are some of the most masterful armorers on the entire continent. When black powder first emerged from down south, we found it difficult to use and non conducive to regular combat. However, our soldiers adapted and created their own weapons to match their style of martial education. Now Oregonian arms are feared and lusted after the world over for their valuable stopping power and excellent quality."
 the_river_oregon_oregon: "The River Oregon"
 the_river_oregon_oregon_desc: "The rest of the Californians refer to the great river of the west as the “Columbian River,” however it is known to us as the “River Oregon.” Its powerful course and extensive tributaries have provided our cities the water they need to thrive and our farms the nutrients they need to grow. In this new age of manufactories and automation, there is no doubt in our minds that the River Oregon will serve as the primary engine of our expansion."
 a_seat_at_the_table_oregon: "A Seat At The Table"
 a_seat_at_the_table_oregon_desc: "For the longest time, our citizens have been left out of the highest echelons of Union politics due to its southern focus. The Nevadans and Libertarians, always at eachothers throats, would never risk adding in an unknown quantity into their delicate balance of power. Through uniting all of the Oregonians under a single nation we have now grown to a point where we demand their attention. No longer will the Oregonians be relegated to the sidelines. We will guide the course of the Union into a horizon of greatness."
 the_beaver_battalion_oregon: "The Beaver Battalion"
 the_beaver_battalion_oregon_desc: "To defend our borders and those of the Union we must be able to meet whatever hostile forces arrive at the gates with even more savage resistance. Gather all of the most skilled soldiers of the land and call them to the capital. Have them train under the most experienced of the generals and become learned in all manner of cutting edge tactics. Once all is said and done, that band of experts will be able to resist an army thirty times their size. The Beaver Battalion will put the veterans of the Redwoods, Utahns, and even Buckeyes to shame!"
 redwood_revenge_oregon: "Redwood Revenge"
 redwood_revenge_oregon_desc: "The memory of the Redwood Invasion still lingers over the heads of our citizens. Among the military minded of our society, there has been a significant effort to understand where the republic failed in its defense of the Redwoods. Through this study our generals have become acutely aware of the best tactics to enact when defending against a larger force. Should our nation ever come into conflict with another army like the Redwoods we will not make the same mistakes."
 legacy_of_the_republic_oregon: "Legacy Of The Republic"
 legacy_of_the_republic_oregon_desc: "For better or for worse, our state lives in the shadow of the old Oregonian Republic. Their dreams of a purely democratic Oregonian state, while misguided, should be admired. They come from a time of optimism, when the world order seemed to be just a construction of man. We all paid the price of this optimism. It left its mark in the charred ruins of Portland and the widows of Eugene. We shall never again attempt to challenge the will of the Almighty and tear apart His divine Union. Our citizens know that their future lies only in our rule."

 northwest_innovation_north_cali_confed_desc: "While Liberty was once known for its rigorous academic culture and insistence on education, most scholars have now come to recognize Washington and Oregon as the new centers of enlightenment. Our universities consistently make groundbreaking discoveries and invent hereto unthought of philosophies. Most new modern movements spawn from within our coffee shops and classrooms. Our citizenry is acutely aware of our role in their discoveries and are quick to ensure that their innovations serve the interest of our administration above all others."
 to_rival_the_south_north_cali_confed: "To Rival The South"
 to_rival_the_south_north_cali_confed_desc: "The cities of Oregon have risen from their Redwood inflicted ashes and take off to the heavens like a phoenix. Architectural innovations and urbanization have caused the once ruined cities of Portland and Salem to rival the esteemed Classical cities of old in the south. We will continue to nurture their growth to ensure that one day we may be seen as the center of Californian civilization."
 the_pacific_legion_north_cali_confed: "The Pacific Legion"
 the_pacific_legion_north_cali_confed_desc: "As the premier Partisan power, we are expected to carry the torch of liberty and ward off all creatures of the night who might wish to prey on our smaller neighbors. To aid in this protection we have assembled a force of well educated and armed martial experts. These soldiers have devoted their lives to keeping the Confederation well guarded against these foreign threats. Should it come to it, they will fight till their last breaths in defense of our state."
 a_dual_presidency_north_cali_confed: "A Dual Presidency"
 a_dual_presidency_north_cali_confed_desc: "Never before in the history of the Union have the various counts had to wonder which region their President represents. Our unification of both Washington and Oregon has made this a difficult question to answer, as most of our rulers seek to represent both the Washingtonians and Oregonians. This has led our representatives in the Union to take on a more unifying attitude as they attempt to represent the needs of diverse groups. A Union governed by our sort will be one in which all Californias are given their proper attention."
 lincolnite_campaign_north_cali_confed: "Lincolnite Campaign"
 lincolnite_campaign_north_cali_confed_desc: "Despite Washington’s historical importance in the Union, rarely have its citizens ventured beyond the Cascades and into the plains of Lincoln. That territory has always been the domain of the Plainwalkers and their ilk. The tantalizing riches of these vast plains are too alluring not the claim. Ready the soldiers and tell them to march towards the rising sun. The grains of Lincoln will feed a thousand generations!"
 cascadian_shipbuilding_north_cali_confed: "Cascadian Shipbuilding"
 cascadian_shipbuilding_north_cali_confed_desc: "Along the ports of the Puget sound, generations of maritime wisdom have crystalized into a shipbuilding culture unlike anything in the entire American continent. Vessels built in the 1400s have remained in use by merchant families to this day. With sails knitted by their seamstresses and hulls hammered by their shipwrights, our navy will be the envy of all others on the waves."
 evergreen_factories_north_cali_confed: "Evergreen Factories"
 evergreen_factories_north_cali_confed_desc: "Ever since the flood, most of a commoner’s possessions have come from their local community. The flourishing of trade during the 17th century has revealed the latent advantages some peoples have in the creation of given goods. Let us embrace this strategy of specialization and become the world’s home of complicated machinery. Our factories, nested within The Founder’s wondrous evergreen forests, will supply every citizen with all the mechanical muscles they need to make their lives easier."

 unite_oregon_nation_desc: "§YShe Flies With Her Own Wings§!\n\nIn dark times like these, it becomes necessary for a people to band together and lift society out of ruin, yet the power hungry rulers of this land will prevent such a recovery. They would rather us be laid heavy with the burden of Presidential debt and Nevadan favors. We refuse to be consigned to this fate. We dream of something greater. A world in which Oregon does not sit and linger in the shadows to die, but one where she soars to the skies once again and flies with her own wings."

The lords provided the vintners with the tools and labor they needed to create their vintage for a portion of the income, while the vintners handled production and sale. To create such a system in the modern day would require extensive expansion of the current vineyards as well as codification of the exact rules into our nation’s laws."

In a time long ago, before the Plainwalkers descended from the north, a few Pugetite towns were founded among the Lincolnite plains. All were wiped out when the mystics arrived. They took over the towns, enforced their way of life, and sent anyone who resisted back across the mountains. We will not let this filth linger in The Founder’s land any longer.

An arbitrary and constantly changing law will upset the citizenry, while a completely static law will not stand the test of time. We need something dynamic but difficult to change, so no bureaucrat or tyrant can come along and reshape the entire government without the due consideration of the citizenry.

The “sister city” of Portland, Vancouver, lies on the other side of the Columbia river. In the past it was a lawless place, full of all the thugs and unscrupulous types that had been exiled from the pristine city of the south. Now it shares a status almost equal to Portland.

When the republic was first founded during The War of The Mad, many of the upper echelons of Oregonian society fled east. They feared that the new Republic of Oregon would slaughter their families and take all of their wealth. Many of these rich nobles settled along the Snake river, where they were joined by Washingtonians fleeing from the Collectivists. Together they established the state of Echo and used their status to earn independence from the Union in the aftermath of the war. Now those traitors sit to our east, we ought to make an effort to punish them for their sins against the Presidency."

In turn, our ships move precious goods north to the cities of Puget and all the way up to Juneau. We will never be absolute in our control of the Cascadian markets until we wrangle complete control over that strait.

 oregon_events.1.t: "Settling Down Our Roots"
 oregon_events.1.d: "Choosing a capital for our new Oregonian nation has been difficult. The obvious choice in days past would have been Portland, but that city has been polluted by republican ideology. Salem is the next runner up. It once served as the capital of the province of Oregon during the American empire’s reign. However, in recent times it has fallen out of favor and shares some of the same republican sentiments as Portland. Eugene would fit, seeing as it has become a new capital of the region in the wake of The War of The Mad, yet there are some among our nation who would be angered by this choice. They believe that the city represents a form of Presidential control, something which, while we are not completely opposed to it, we would like to avoid. The next option lies on the coast at Astoria whose vital docks and important status in the Cascadian markets could give our administration a maritime bend. On these same economic lines, the city of Bend along the Deschutes could also serve this purpose as a commercially important link between Jeffersonian and Oregonian merchants. Perhaps we could even take an eastern focus with our capital and choose one of the cities of the boonies in Morrow or Crook. The large number of local nobles in these areas could provide our state useful income for ensuring the east rises to the same status as the west. With so many options and so much to consider, it's not difficult to see why a clear consensus hasn’t emerged. It is now up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide where we will settle down and build a mighty Oregonian state."

 oregon_events.2.d: "Our conquest of Oregon has brought with it a wrinkle in respect to the wine industries. In more divided times, each lord would work hand and hand with viticultural specialists known as vintners to ensure that the vineyards produced lucrative outputs. Competition emerged between the different lords who worked hard to ensure that their product would be bought on the market over their neighbors. Now that we have united all of these lords under one roof, they have become complacent. Most are willing to settle for more meager incomes and hire only a few vintners. This has weakened our position in the wine market and quickly led to other vintages rising above our own in demand. We cannot let this stand. Our economic advisors have proposed two solutions, each of which has its own benefits and drawbacks. Firstly we could take control of the vineyards ourselves and ensure that they receive proper attention. While this would increase our responsibilities, it would also allow us to take more of the profits and tighten our grip on the growing class of wealthy vintners. Secondly we could turn over control of the vineyards to the vintners, allowing them to control their own production. Further, we can encourage these vintners to compete against one another by providing incentives and lesser taxes to those that sell the most. While this will certainly increase the status of the vintners and lessen our own power, it could potentially produce a better product than would be available under our own control. "
