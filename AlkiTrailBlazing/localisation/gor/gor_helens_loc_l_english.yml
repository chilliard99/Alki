 wide_family_trees_helens: "Wide Family Trees"
 wide_family_trees_helens_desc: "The Vancouvers of Washington are an ancient family. Their roots can be traced back to the days of the Californian Kingdom, when the land was dominated by tyrannical lords and most commoners labored under serfdom. Eliza Vancouver, a talented alchemist, made a name for her family by acting as a healer for the ruling Dach dynasty. Through diplomatic maneuvering, she placed her kin in the position to inherit prosperous lands along the Columbia river. The Vancouver family reigned over the territories ever since, with a brief exile during the Alaskan occupation. Their ties to many of the other prominent royal families of the Union allowed them to claim the title of electorate in the wake of The War of the Mad."
 voice_of_washington_helens: "Voice of Washington"
 voice_of_washington_helens_desc: "As the electorate from Washington, our nation is given the heavy burden of representing the needs of the region. With such a wide variety of opinions from the Pinkos of Tacoma to the Trueheirs of Yakama, this will be no easy task."
 redwood_retirees_helens: "Redwood Retirees"
 redwood_retirees_helens_desc: "Tired, battle weary, and fearful of death at the hands of the Reds, many members of the Redwood order stopped on the other side of the Columbian river after their long conquest of Oregon. In Vancouver, they were treated as heroes and liberators. Not wanting to lose this newfound status, many of the soldiers simply didn’t go back home and settled down in Washington."
 washington_paper_helens: "Washington Paper"
 washington_paper_helens_desc: "While Tacoma may have had the first paper mill, along the Columbia river is where the practice of Washingtonian papermaking really took off. The tributaries of the Columbia river provided the new mills a level of mechanical might which could not be reliably done by humans alone. "
 tampering_in_oregon_helens: "Tampering in Oregon"
 tampering_in_oregon_helens_desc: "Oregon after The War of the Mad was a complete mess. The total destruction of many of its most valuable cities and constant fear of rebellion made managing the region almost impossible. Nonetheless, many factions within the Union attempted to manipulate Oregon from outside of its borders. Most notable of these factions were the Traditionalists who were staunchly opposed to the creation of an Oregonian state in any form. They found an unlikely ally in the Progressive Helens who wished for Oregon to be shattered into smaller counties. With financial support from the Traditionalists, the Hellenic elector frequently involved itself in Oregonian wars in an attempt to keep the peace in the region."
 guild_cartels_helens: "Guild Cartels"
 guild_cartels_helens_desc: "Commerce along the Columbia river was complicated and driven largely by the demand of those further south. Such an intricate system was too much for a single count or king to manage, so much of its trade was conducted and facilitated through a series of guilds. Over time, most of the guilds that specialized in creating a particular good merged together. The subsequent emergence of cartels focused around specific industries brought hardship and economic prosperity. The counts of the area were forced to contend with the growing class of powerful merchants, but production and sale of goods reached all time highs under their control."
 fort_vancouver_helens: "Fort Vancouver"
 fort_vancouver_helens_desc: "Fort Vancouver was established during the 3rd century as a forward base of operations for the brief American invasion into Washington. While time has not been gracious to the structure, its once dominating stature compared to the rest of the city can still be seen along the city’s north wall. Some of the stones that support the city’s defenses today were placed there by American soldiers centuries ago."

That fool let the Alaskans continue their occupation of the north and even gave them control of Seattle. Such an act revealed that we are truly alone in Washington.

Despite, or maybe because, of its valuable status, the river has never been fully managed by one nation. Our advisors estimate that if we created a river fleet of large enough size we could manage the trading of all goods in our state. For a small fee, merchants could load up their goods onto our own vessels rather than relying on the cartels. This would give us incredible control of the river’s commerce and add to our state’s trade influence."

Great Tahoma, as the Americans called it, was the bustling urban center of their empire. Its various quarters were divided based on the different tribes of the Yakaman confederacy. While all other empires rose and fell, Tahoma remained. When the Californians arrived in the north, many attempted to conquer the city from the Yakamans, but were quickly repelled by their expert soldiers. Its distinct walls, laden with granite columns, were too mighty for any force to penetrate. The city was abandoned some time during the 8th century due to an eruption from the nearby Rainier. Cooled magma coated large portions of the city. For the following generations Tahoma served as a spiritual place where the Piitl'iyawilá of the Yakamans could be educated. Our stewardship over the city should continue this tradition and preserve its beauty for those that come after."

If we wish to claim the presidency for ourselves, we will need to play this game.

They conquered most of Washington in the chaos and reorganized the region into a series of communes. Eventually, when the old emperor was surrounded on all sides, Alaska signed a peace treaty with Lewis that gave them control of everything north of the Columbia river. Once the Redwoods arrived on their borders they demanded that the Reds return what they had taken. The Alaskans simply showed the old treaty and said that they owned the land. Before fighting broke out, a delegation of Union diplomats met in Seattle to try and come up with a compromise. Together with the Alaskans they divided Washington into the political landscape that it is today. In our hour of need, the president let a bunch of Nevadans decide what should happen to our people rather than fighting for our independence. The disastrous results of this decision are plain to see. Parts of the Olympic Peninsula and Puget are under the brutal occupation of those tyrannical Collectivists. A key part of the deal was the limited independence of Seattle. The city would be allowed to retain some of its autonomy, though it would be under Alaskan control. Alaska directly agreed to these terms, yet there are reports that their own soldiers have occupied Seattle and overthrown its local government. Such a flagrant violation of the treaty has led some in our nation to consider if we should revisit the issue.

While the Alaskans may see the release of territories as the most agreeable option, there is no guarantee that they won’t just go ahead and reconquer them later down the line.

 helens_events.12.d: "Our proposal to the Alaskans was rejected. As part of the threat included in the letter, we must now go to war to reclaim Washington. Rouse the men from their homes, it is time to make the Union whole."
 helens_events.12.a: "Well... To War!"
 helens_events.13.t: "Advanced Rejected"
 helens_events.13.d: "The President’s proposal to the Alaskans was rejected. As part of the threat included in the letter, we must now join the president in a war to reclaim Washington. Rouse the men from their homes, it is time to make the Union whole."
 helens_events.13.a: "Well... To War!"
 helens_events.14.t: "Cool Heads Prevail"
 helens_events.14.d: "The Alaskans have decided to accept our proposal and are currently pulling their troops out of Washington. While we are free from the threat of war for now, we must make sure that the Alaskans do not return in the future. Investment in the region should be a high priority for the remainder of our administration. Even though there is still much more to do, let us take a moment to enjoy our success and celebrate the return of Washington."
 helens_events.14.a: "Wonderous!"
 helens_events.15.t: "Washingtonian Indpendence"
 helens_events.15.d: "The Alaskans have decided to accept the presidential proposal and are currently pulling their troops out of Washington. Any territories which were once under their reign will now be independent and governed by their own local dukes. While we will not gain anything from this new treaty, Washington being under Californian rule once again is an undoubtedly positive outcome for the Union as a whole."
 helens_events.15.a: "Freedom for our Brothers!"
 helens_events.16.t: "Presidential Betrayl"
 helens_events.16.d: "The Alaskans have decided to accept the presidential proposal and are currently pulling their troops out of Washington. Any territories which were once under their reign will now be under the control of the president of the Union. This unprecedented powerplay is extremely worrying for the future of Washingtonian independence. It seems that we have simply shrugged off one oppressor and replaced it with another. We hope that the president will soon leave the region, lest we be forced to intervene."
 helens_events.16.a: "How could they do this to us?"
 helens_events.17.t: "Our Washington"
 helens_events.17.d: "The Alaskans have decided to accept the presidential proposal and are currently pulling their troops out of Washington. Any territories which were once under their reign will now be under the control of our own county. This has seriously bolstered our standing in the region and given us the opportunity to lead Washington into a new era. Let us take a moment to celebrate this great outcome and thank the president for their hard work in making it happen."
 helens_events.17.a: "Victory at last."
 helens_events.18.t: "Presidential Rejection"
 helens_events.18.d: "The president has rejected our request for negotiation with Alaska. We can either drop the issue now or go forward and try to talk with the state on our own. Of course, this will be far more difficult as we are significantly less prominent than the president."
 helens_events.18.a: "Go ahead alone."
 helens_events.18.b: "Not our job."
 helens_events.19.t: "Strategy for Approaching Alaska"
 helens_events.19.d: "There are two clear paths forward for the future of the region. First, we could demand that the Alaskans relinquish all of their territory in Washington and give the lands back to the local counts. Alternatively we could demand that the Alaskans hand the territory over to us to use how we see fit. While the Alaskans may see the release of territories as the most agreeable option, there is no guarantee that they won’t just go ahead and reconquer them later down the line. On the other hand, if we press them into giving us the territory directly they are likely to decline and our two nations will be at war. If we wish to avoid war, we should carefully consider which option we present forward."
 helens_events.19.a: "Demand a release of counties."
 helens_events.19.b: "Demand they give us the territory."
 helens_events.20.t: "Notice From a Lowly Count"
 helens_events.20.d: "A diplomat from, of all places [From.GetName], has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] today. They came bearing a demand from the count of Helens that we withdraw from the city of Seattle. Years ago, when their flimsy collective was fraught with rebellion, we took advantage of their weakness and liberated the territory of Washington. We enlightened the people of the region to the nature of Utopia and gave them noble work. Yet we were forced to retreat when those butcherous Redwoods came knocking. To prevent a repeat of Oregon, we negotiated with a few haughty barons from the Union and divided Washington into several independent counties. We were given control of Seattle as part of this deal, however the president is now claiming that this was not the case. This is an obvious attempt by those traitorous dogs to undermine our victory and enslave our people. They demand that we cede all of our Washingtonian territories over to them to use as they see fit. While this is not ideal, the letter states that if we refuse their offer the elector will declare war for the territories. We must ultimately decide if holding onto Washington is worth this war and the future ones that could occur over this territory."

 helens_events.24.t: "A Mess up North"
 helens_events.24.d: "News has reached [Root.Capital.GetName] of a war breaking out between Helens and Alaska. Apparently, the electorate tried to use the Alaskan occupation of Seattle as a pretense to renegotiate the treaty that carved up the region in the first place. Such a foolhearty move was made worse when they backed it up with the threat of war. Now they are locked in a conflict which they are unlikely to win. Let us hope that they can somehow claim victory against the superior foe."
 helens_events.24.a: "Well, we wish them the best of luck."
 helens_events.25.t: "Treaty of Seattle Resolved"
 helens_events.25.d: "News has reached [Root.Capital.GetName] of a surprising resolution to the situation in Washington. Apparently, the electorate tried to use the Alaskan occupation of Seattle as a pretense to renegotiate the treaty that carved up the region in the first place. This was somehow successful, as the Alaskans have just pulled out of the region and given independence to the local counts. While we were not involved in its execution, we can nonetheless claim credit for this development and use it to boost our presidency’s legitimacy in the eyes of the Union."
 helens_events.25.a: "One less problem."
 helens_events.26.t: "Hellenic Power Play"
 helens_events.26.d: "News has reached [Root.Capital.GetName] of a surprising resolution to the situation in Washington. Apparently, the electorate tried to use the Alaskan occupation of Seattle as a pretense to renegotiate the treaty that carved up the region in the first place. This was somehow successful, as the Alaskans have just pulled out of the region and given all their territory to the Hellenic elector. While taking back so much land into the Union is undoubtedly a win for our administration, we would be wise to watch Helens closely. With this newfound powerand diplomatic prowess they could challenge our control of the presidency."
 helens_events.26.a: "Good for them."
