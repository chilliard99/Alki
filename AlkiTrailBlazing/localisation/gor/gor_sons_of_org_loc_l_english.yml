 wartime_dictator_sons_of_oregon: "Wartime Dictator"
 wartime_dictator_sons_of_oregon_desc: "Rather than a traditional President, our republic is helmed by a dictator until we manage to unify the Oregonians. Such a move, while undemocratic, is necessary to ensure that dissent does not foster into disunity. Political strife is a peacetime game, we must remain unified if we wish to restore the Republic to its former glory. The dictator has our full faith that when the day comes for the restoration of elections, they will proudly hand in their crown and let the people rule."
 covert_tactics_sons_of_oregon: "Covert Tactics"
 covert_tactics_sons_of_oregon_desc: "For almost half a century, the fervent of our organization have operated under the radar as unassuming farmers, tradesmen, and nobles, only taking off their facades at night to meet with their fellow Brothers of Oregon. Stepping into the light has had both its advantages and disadvantages in this respect. We will need to rely on our stealthier cells now more than ever to carry out the Republic’s will and assert our agenda across the Union."

 legacy_of_the_republic_sons_of_oregon_desc: "From birth we’ve been raised with tales of the great Oregonian Republic. A land free from the molestation of monarchs and the interference of lords. Where serf and nobility live alongside each other in golden cities. It was the power hungry of the Union, enraged by our prosperity, who marched into our paradise and laid it all to waste. We were more powerful than them, but even the most righteous will fall to sin should he fall out of favor with the Almighty. Those in charge of the old Republic forgot who they served, we will not make such mistakes."

 support_from_abroad_sons_of_oregon_desc: "While the Union has been hostile to our resurgence, abroad we have seen wide support from all manner of foreign leaders. While we assume that most of these rulers only wish to see us succeed so that the President becomes weaker, their aid has nonetheless inspired many to venture to our state and raise arms for the Republican cause. Foreign volunteers pour into our borders day by day, with their support we will no doubt find victory."

 trailblazer_support_sons_of_oregon_desc: "We have found a close ally in the Trailblazers of Portland. For years their lot have supported our organization, offering resources to local cells wherever they are hired. With our new resurgence, the Trailblazers have generously offered us their services at a discounted price. Further, they reached out to the other companies of California and pulled some strings to extend the discount to their services as well."

 redwood_defense_sons_of_oregon_desc: "Stories of the brutes of the Redwood Order have been used by parents to terrify their children into obedience ever since the invasion of Oregon. From a young age, we have come to fear even the word Redwood itself. Should we come into contact with any member of that infernal order, we will fight with an unbridled strength. We will not let Oregon fall into the clutch of those monsters ever again."
 pillage_economy_sons_of_oregon: "Pillage Economy"
 pillage_economy_sons_of_oregon_desc: "Due to the actions of the President and Oregon’s lack of existing infrastructure, our state finds itself in the unenviable position of having empty coffers. Luckily for us, there are many states that surround us which have recently grown fat with ducats. Funds meant to restore the cities of Oregon in the wake of the Redwood invasion can now serve a better purpose in funding the Republic’s restoration. Our soldiers will live off of these funds and the land of the common people. We imagine they will be overjoyed to hand over their hard work so that our soldiers can continue the good fight."

 oregonianmisc_events.1.t: "Son of Oregon"
 oregonianmisc_events.1.d: "Troubling news has reached  [Root.Capital.GetName] from Oregon where it seems that the region’s rebellion problems have reached a breaking point. Before The War of The Mad and the ascendency of the elector of Willamette, Oregon was left without representation in the Electoral College. At the dawn of the 15th century, many of the region’s counts attempted to join together in a coalition to demand one of their sort be given the title of electorate. While this plan did not pan out, what quickly emerged from their talks was the idea of a Pan-Oregonian state. The Franciscan President of the time shot the idea down, saying that it was a form of “Neobarony” that would have been resisted militarily by the entire Progressive caucus. The dream of a united Oregon continued to linger in the minds of the powerful of the region until the ascendency of Lewis “The Mad” Francisco. Under his Presidency, the Oregonians once again met in the city of Portland and proclaimed their intention to unite under a single Republic. Lewis supported this movement, a fact that greatly upset many of his Traditionalist rivals. A collection of these disgruntled counts rallied their armies and marched north to occupy Portland and arrest the traitorous dukes.\n\nOn their way to the city, The War of The Mad broke out along the Joaquin. The Traditionalists were forced to turn away from the city and march back home to defend Nevada. The Oregonians made good on their promise and formally declared a united Republic. This new state quickly left the Union and formed an alliance with the Mad Presidency. They sent volunteers and funds to continue Lewis’s campaign in the south along with beginning their own conquest into the city of Warm Springs. The famous Crescent Delegation, involving the Traditionalist caucus, the Napan President, the Grandmaster of the Redwood Order, and the Celestial deserter Mutsun Parker, decided the Union’s strategy in dealing with these Republicans. The Redwood Order, an old relic of the crusades turned mercenary company, would go north and pacify the Oregonians.\n\nThe Redwood Campaign was an absolute disaster. While Oregon was reigned in, it came at significant cost to the region’s well being and population. The Republicans fought until their dying breath in defense of their cities. The Redwoods were made up of mostly young citizens and countryside farmers who had never seen the battlefield. They had no regard for the etiquette of warfare and used brutal tactics against the Oregonians. Portland, Salem, Eugene, Astoria, all burned to the ground in pursuit of snuffing out the Republic.\n\nSuch brutality only bred anger. After the war, an underground faction of revolutionaries known as the Sons of Oregon began operating in the region. They struck fear into the hearts of rulers across the north due to their brutal tactics of assassination and arson. Through careful covert maneuvers and outright revolt, it seems that they have risen up and now taken control of considerable territory in Oregon. The task now falls to our administration to deal with these revolutionaries before they destroy all of what we built."

We admit, it has been hard to consider the concerns of a group which is so far away, but the solution to this issue is not the exit of Washington. Their members in the Union Congress have successfully passed a bill which would remove all Washingtonians from the Union, whether they support our Presidency or not. We are now left in the difficult position of deciding whether to veto the bill and make a commitment to reign in Washington or let the Union be free. Of course, we wish to see Washington stay in the Union, but it might be for the best if we let the region go. The political ramifications of a failure to rein them in could be dire.

In a move to garner public support for reigning in the region, the President has called all counts of the Union to vote on whether or not the bill should be vetoed. A veto is only a temporary solution. If control of Washington is not regained before the end of this administration, it is likely that their supporters will get the votes necessary to override the President.

Following the passage of the Two Unions Act, all counts of Washington have been completely removed from the Union and given their full independence. We greatly regret the lack of attention given to your people’s needs and hope that at some point in the future you may once again join our ranks. With a heavy heart, we give this final goodbye and wish you luck in the wake of this split.\n\n-Office Of The Californian Presidency"

It turns out that their sort of hate the President almost as much as we do. Perhaps with the support of the Alaskans we can win this fight and usher in a Second Republic.

It is clear that their intention is to take on the mantle of that old regime, which would mean freedom from the Union and the rise of the Oregonian people.

 sonsorg_events.11.d: "It was mid-day in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The sun was high in the sky, but most of the Dictator’s advisors were gathered in the shade underneath the capital’s steps. The total party was six strong, three of which were from an organization calling itself “The Green Scarves.” For months they had conducted operations further south in Liberty and Nevada, attempting to garner influence in Progressive and Traditionalist circles. Through excessive patience and ambition they have managed to put a mole within the President’s own core of close advisors. This mole has unfettered access to the President’s quarters and daily schedule. The initial plan was to learn Union troop movements and any plans of intervention against our state, but then someone suggested what was lingering on all of their minds: What about an assassination? Laying low the President of the Union would be an unprecedented move. To see a representative of The Founder’s will struck down would shock the Union to its very core. Before giving the order, the Green Scarves wished to meet with the Dictator and get [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] approval. An eerie silence fell upon the group after this explanation. The Dictator’s typically stoic advisors shifted their weight and wiped the sweat from their brows. There was so much to consider. Was the world where a President can be assassinated truly one which we wish to usher in? Would a mole continue to survive into the future in such a precarious position? Why are there so many cells of our organization operating out of our control? If someone can get the President, they can get the Dictator. Setting a precedent is dangerous. Yet, judgment must come for one’s crimes committed in this life. Through assassinating the President we may create another Lewis, or Founder forbid, usher in the rise of an emperor.

 sonsorg_events.12.d: "It took them the entire night to find the body. Four guards are stationed outside of the President’s chamber. They stand ready, in case any threat comes from outside to harm the President therein. There was the normal gallery of evening visitors, a Nevadan duke, a chef, and a few advisors. The primary guard gave the customary knock to let the President know that the house staff had gone to their quarters. He received no response. It took them the entire night to find the body. The stars dragged across the sky and four guards stood ready. When the moon was directly above they switched with the morning crew and headed to rest. There was commotion outside as a group of drunks sang patriotic songs. Not hearing any stirring from the President’s room, the outside guard was not instructed to disperse them. The first mornings rang out and a courtesy knock was given to wake the President. Hearing no response, the guard waited another hour and then gave another knock. A close advisor to the President arrived at the capital, angered that they were not ready. After a lengthy argument, the primary guard entered the Presidential chamber and ran back out, crying out that the President was slain. It took them the entire night to find the body.\n\nThe news of the President’s assassination has shaken the Union. The Electoral college quickly chose a replacement to serve as the successor, yet the damage was already done. A figure thought to be so untouchable has been laid low. Investigations into the culprit quickly followed. It turns out that the slaughter was done by a member of the Sons of Oregon, a revolutionary group bent on tearing the region out of the Union. The murderer was caught fleeing into Oregon and was summarily executed for the crime. Across the Union counts and citizens now call upon the new administration to remove the Oregonian. Their reign of terror has gone on for far too long. If California is to truly be free, it cannot be done while the Oregonians persist."

Even if every city of their savage order was burned to the ground again, it is likely that those roaches would just emerge from the ashes, even madder than before. A bill is circulating through the caucuses and will likely make its way to the Union Congress within the next weeks which plans to remove Oregon. It will have the support of each major party. If we wish to keep this Union whole, we will need to be clever in our next steps. Framing the Oregonian exit as something voluntary, where the respective counts can keep their dignity and leave, could prevent us from losing everything. Of course, such a course of actions could also lead to further uprisings, but the Union’s unity may be more valuable than the damage they may cause. Without Oregon, who is to say that Washington won’t leave next or even Jefferson! Let us call an Emergency Session of the Congress and let them decide what the future of Oregon should be."

With a somber tone they addressed the Congress, calling not for a ban of the Orgonians, but a chance for them to decide their own fate. The Oregonians will be able to choose if they want to remain in the Union or leave. We are now faced with deciding whether to give them this choice or punish their crimes immediately."
