 red_washington_ideas: "Red Washington Ideas"
 red_washington_fight_for_freedom: "Fight for Freedom"
 red_washington_fight_for_freedom_desc: "We have liberated the people of Washington from their oppressors. Now we must be ever vigilant to ensure that we never fall to the hands of tyrants again. We are surrounded by power hungry jackals who wish to see our people return to their chains. If our armies are aware of the enemy’s intention, they will defend our great homeland to their dying breath. Death is a preferable alternative to their tyranny."
 red_washington_workers_rights: "Worker's Rights"
 red_washington_workers_rights_desc: "The kingdoms of this continent are obsessed with keeping power centered within the highest seats of government. In a quest to maintain this order they oppress all those that lie beneath them. It's no wonder why their citizens are always rising up and trying to overturn their order. The liberties provided by our state will ensure that we face no such issues."
 red_washington_little_red_books: "Little Red Books"
 red_washington_little_red_books_desc: "As a center for bookmaking in the Collectivist world, we have been granted with the great honor of printing our holy text: The Manifesto. Every man, woman, and child of this grand nation should have access to that glorious red book so that they might understand why they work."
 red_washington_wealth_redistribution: "Wealth Redistribution"
 red_washington_wealth_redistribution_desc: "We live in a world of finite resources and unlimited greed. For this reason we are required to act against the best judgment of some of our citizens to ensure that those less fortunate can prosper. If along the way we can enrich ourselves, I don’t think anyone would mind."
 red_washington_mutual_aid: "Mutual Aid"
 red_washington_mutual_aid_desc: "Our allies in the north have slowly developed a strong commercial presence along the Pacific Coast. Now that we have joined them in the faith and come to dominate our own region, we can assist them in exerting their influence further south. With our economic might combined no other nation could possibly stand in the way of our eventual monopolization. Every ship which travels these waters will serve the interests of the republic."
 red_washington_the_auditors: "The Auditors"
 red_washington_the_auditors_desc: "All of Washington lies under our grasp, yet there are some who resist our wondrous message of Utopia. These individuals will never let go of their dangerous beliefs and will continue to confuse the masses as to their true purpose. Our nation needs some sort of protection against these agitators. A private force of the true hearted who have the backing of the state will no doubt put an end to this issue. "
 red_washington_nobility_in_labor: "Nobility in Labor"
 red_washington_nobility_in_labor_desc: "Whether they work for the pursuit of Utopia or simply to make a living, our citizens are united in their toil. There is a nobility in such labor. To create something out of nothing and improve the world through a hard day’s work. The tyrants of the world look at our productivity with shock and awe. The citizens enslaved under their regimes cannot even approach our nation’s level of efficiency. It is our freedom and acceptance of labor that puts us beyond them."

 red_california_collectivist_representative: "Collectivist Representatives"
 red_california_collectivist_representative_desc: "As the preeminent Collectivist nation on the globe we serve as a representative for all those who follow the Manifesto’s teachings but lie outside our borders. Because of this, we carry the heavy responsibility of representing the faith to those who are hostile to its existence. We must convince all of the laborers of the world that we are their friends. It is those who wish to oppress them, those that oppose our message, that are the true enemies."
 red_california_union_inheritance: "Union Inheritance"
 red_california_union_inheritance_desc: "Through our grand conquests of this land we have inherited a grand legacy. Even though it was governed by a cabal of corrupt nobles, the Union was the closest thing this continent had to true democracy since the old Joaquin republics of antiquity. Instead of tearing down their old symbols we ought to look at them in a new light. In the long shadow of their history we will write a new national story for the Californians."
 red_california_privilege_education: "Privledge Education"
 red_california_privilege_education_desc: "Our state is vast and full of a wide diversity of peoples. It is important that those who hold more status than the others know the advantages they have over those below them, so that they understand why they must give so much. Once they come to understand the plight of those beneath them, the fortunate will line up to give away their possesions for the greater good."
 red_california_red_sun: "Red Sun"
 red_california_red_sun_desc: "The tyrants of this continent will come to fear our great might! The fury of the setting sun will crush their lavish manors and torch their prized farmlands. When the skies turn red and they choke on the ash of their mistakes, we will show them no mercy."
 red_california_egalitarian_society: "Egalitarian Society"
 red_california_egalitarian_society_desc: "No matter the color of their skin, the number of their Gods, or the amount of coins in their pocket, each citizen in our great republic is given the same set of rights. While there may be some who have more influence or exemption from particular laws, all of our citizens have baseline protections from tyranny. Such protections have given our citizens comfort and prevented many from feeling dissatisfied with our rule."
 red_california_crimson_hats: "Crimson Hats"
 red_california_crimson_hats_desc: "Earlier in our reign, we established an order of faithful individuals to preserve peace among the more zealous of our opposition. As we have conquered more land and expanded, the number of nonCollectivists has grown and the power of this order along with it. Though we have tried our best to keep their existence secretive, many of our public are aware of their operations and have come to fear the sight of their signature crimson hats. This fear will be a useful tool for our reign. Let all those who wish to raise a hammer to the mechanism of progress fear the sight of the distinctive red."
 red_california_utopia_pursuit: "Utopia's Pursuit"
 red_california_utopia_pursuit_desc: "The words of the Manifesto were clear in their promotion of a global revolution. To bring about Utopia all workers of the world must be united under one command and directed in their perfection of production. Such was the goal of the noble Trotsky in his conquests of Rusland and such will be our goal in our expansion beyond California and into the rest of the American continent."

Their self righteous beliefs were rooted in a fear that the most wealthy of their societies would lose their status under the more egalitarian republic. Such greed and arrogance boils our blood. We will do what the Oregonians were too weak to do those years ago and claim their riches for the common citizen."

With such majestic mountains and lush forest one can get distracted from their true purpose. The lands of Jefferson lie just beyond our Oregonian front, if we wish to unite this continent’s coast under the Manifesto’s guidance, we will need to march into those mountains and conquer those within."

While we are strangers in this new land, the locals know every nook and cranny. They have used this knowledge to harass our armies and attack at inopportune moments. Such cheap tactics must be punished. We ought to consolidate the rougher territory before pushing further south so that we are not surprised by any hidden counter offensives."

In ancient times the region was inhabited by a collection of republican city states who traded and warred against each other incessantly. Our ancestors traded with these states and came to view them in a positive light. Such positive relations still hold their weight in our minds centuries later and make our next steps more difficult. No matter our feelings we must march south and open a front into Liberty. "

This is not surprising, such direct representation was only fit for a state a tenth of our size. If we wish to unite the entire globe under the Manifesto’s message, we will need to first reform our state into something more accommodating. We must start with better divisions of power, a more comprehensive congress, and selective rights for certain classes."

Eugene, Portland, and Salem were badly damaged by the brutal Redwood campaign during The War of the Mad. Those savages burnt most of the cities to the ground rather than face the armies of Oregon on the open battlefield with honor. Their ruined status will make them easy pickings for our purposes."

The Californias were liberated from restraints of civilization. In their savagery they were free. The Americans disturbed this peace and forced upon them their false prophet.

Under the reign of others they will no doubt be forced to give up their cultural heritage and conform to the common beliefs. We believe that our republic can provide them a way out of this predicament. Under our rule they will have the same rights as any other citizen and be allowed to continue their traditional practices undisturbed. While they will not retain their whole independence, such a situation is far more preferable than total erasure of their identity. Our diplomats have already constructed the proposition and are ready to send out the argument at a moment’s notice.

It seems that through the expansion of our state and the slow climb of ambition bureaucrats that our administration has come to control a majority of the voting population of the Miller’s Union. If we wanted to we could force a successful vote for the union’s official integration into the republic. This way we could directly create laws for its management and use its profits to fund our different aims.
