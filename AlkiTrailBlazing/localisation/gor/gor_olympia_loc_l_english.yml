 hand_of_the_president_olympia: "Hand of the President"
 hand_of_the_president_olympia_desc: "Washington is a land fraught with those who peddle seditious thought and outright traitors. The Alaskan occupation emboldened these individuals, it is the job of the loyal servants of the President to rout them out and restore the status quo. The Budds of Olympia were staunch supporters of the Napan presidency even before its formalization by the Treaty of Carson City. Through careful political navigation, the Olympians managed to carve out a niche in Washington as the representative of Napan rule. Their network of diplomats in the halls of the Sacramento Congress granted the Olympians an unprecedented level of influence over Union affairs."
 red_legacy_olympia: "Red Legacy"
 red_legacy_olympia_desc: "During the War of the Mad, the Alaskans capitalized on the Union’s disorganization and invaded Washington. The city of Olympia was conquered in the summer of 1430 which was quickly followed by the capitulation of the rest of the peninsula. While under the rule of the Alaskans, the territory was reorganized into the Democratic Republic of Olympia. Most nobles fled the realm before the Collectivist arrival, but those who didn’t were rounded up and shipped north to Anchorage to be spread throughout the united Communes. While some members of the common class embraced this new Collectivist life in earnest, others resisted. The underground Pugite Liberation Movement, founded by Matt Budd and his sister Cora, subtly worked against their occupiers and assisted the Redwood league in retaking the region. Many in Olympia still remember the desperation of those times and have become more zealous in response."
 unite_the_penninsula_olympia: "Unite the Penninsula"
 unite_the_penninsula_olympia_desc: "Olympia held control over the entire peninsula for centuries before the arrival of the Red Menace to the north. They now pilfer our ancestral lands, pillage our fields, and spit on what our ancestors built. It is time for the sons of this land to rise up and retake what is ours!"
 hoh_olympia: "Hoh"
 hoh_olympia_desc: "In the middle of the Olympic peninsula lies a forest like no other in all of California. Constant rains assault any traveler who journeys into the Hoh. The rainforest served as a place of spirituality for the ancient peoples of Washington. It is littered with stone carvings from older civilizations. Its vegetation rich terrain made it the perfect place to resist invading armies. When the Alaskans attempted to conquer the lands north of Olympia, they faced heavy resistance from guerilla fighters in the Hoh. Even up until the end of the War of the Mad in ‘33, there was still a sizable faction of mountain men who managed to resist subjugation."
 evergreen_remains_olympia: "Siren Remains"
 evergreen_remains_olympia_desc: "In 621, centuries before the Union was founded, a collection of guild captains in the city of Seattle banded together to found a merchant guild known as the Siren League. They recruited artisans and sailors to create and ship goods along the pacific coast. Throughout the history of Washington, the Siren League brought the region riches and eventually conflict. Today, the league stands as a shadow of its former self. When the Alaskans invaded in 1429, they executed most of the League’s chairmen for their role in arms smuggling to Vancouver. What remains of the League’s fleet and stores are split between Olympia and Seattle."
 disrupting_the_strike_olympia: "Disrupting the Strike"
 disrupting_the_strike_olympia_desc: "The Alaskan Communes declared a general strike on the Union of California in 1439 due to their occupation of Seattle. Craftsmen and nobles along the Cascadian coast suffered the most from this decision and lobbied to their dukes to find new avenues for trade. As a solution, some rulers opted to allow the former merchant vessels to carry weaponry and deliver their goods forcefully. These privateers were extremely lucrative and led to an unofficial end to the general strike."
 mavis_and_sons_olympia: "Mavis and Sons"
 mavis_and_sons_olympia_desc: "While Seattle has served as the economic and cultural center of Puget, Olympia historically bore most of the region’s artists. Northern Classicalist painters like Kreiger and Yundt created pieces which bolstered the image of the union and deepened many’s Constitutional faith. Into the 16th and 17th centuries, Olympia saw an explosion in Theatre. The acting company Mavis and Sons traveled throughout most of the West and performed some of the seminal pieces of Californian literature for foreign audiences. Their traveling show, in addition to the spread of Classicalist novels with the printing press, helped to create intrigue about California in the eyes of those in the east. The archetypal image of Californians as ancient and mystical people emerged in large part due to these Olympian natives. "

 great_oly_olympia_title: "Great Oly"
 great_oly_olympia_desc: "Much of Washington has been locked in time ever since the invasion and occupation during The War of the Mad. This is not lost on many of the citizens of Olympia. As streets crumble and wells dry up around them, they have begun to affectionately call their home “Old Oly”, shortened because the city is only half of what it once was. It is our duty to prevent our realm from falling into ruin and restore Olympia to its once great status."

 gateway_to_the_north_olympia_title: "Gateway to the North"
 gateway_to_the_north_olympia_desc: "In ancient times, the Californians established a series of trading outposts along the Pacific coast in order to exchange goods with the Arboreans. Over time, these outposts evolved into cities and kingdoms which came to rival those further south. Grays Harbor and Seattle were among the most northerly cities Californian traders would travel to and developed a reputation as the border between the known and unknown world. As a gateway to what lies in the north, we are in the perfect position to establish a powerful commercial presence. Through expanding our navy and developing our ports, we could rival nations that are far larger than us in the market. "
 peninsular_ambitions_olympia_title: "Peninsular Ambitions"
 peninsular_ambitions_olympia_desc: "A time long, before the Alaskans came to dwell in Washington, our ancestors once lorded over the entirety of the Olympic peninsula. Its gentle waves and supple forests guided our worship of the Founder. The Communists of the north are slowly tainting this natural beauty in their incessant quest of development. We must reassert our rule over these lands before all is lost."

 olympic_reunion_olympia_title: "Olympic Reunion"
 olympic_reunion_olympia_desc: "With legitimate claims to the territories of the Alaskans, we are now in the perfect position to challenge them for supremacy of Washington. Just beyond that border lies so many split families and divided clans. Our conquest of the region will no doubt be met with open arms, as brothers are reunited once again."
 rebuilding_strength_olympia_title: "Rebuilding Strength"
 rebuilding_strength_olympia_desc: "When the Alaskans conquered the lands of Washington, they sent most scholars, guild leaders, and generals north to be redistributed throughout their twisted kingdom. Our new generation of soldiers are without discipline and lacking in numbers. We must put out a call for all those in the cities and countryside to venture to [Root.Capital.GetName], so that they may fight for the glory of [Root.GetName]!"
 traitor_of_tacoma_olympia_title: "Traitor of Tacoma"
 traitor_of_tacoma_olympia_desc: "Our realm has a cold relationship with Tacoma. When the republic was created in the aftermath of the War of the Mad, they were expected to provide a buffer between the Alaskan vassals of Seattle and the Union. Over time the Tacomans have tied themselves closer to the reds, even overthrowing their monarch in favor of a warped form of democracy. We must snuff out their extremist spirit before they do something truly tragic."

 routing_the_reds_olympia_title: "Routing the Reds"
 routing_the_reds_olympia_desc: "Our victories in Seattle, Tacoma, and Olympia have prepared us for the final phase of our reclamation. The Collectivist filth cannot be tolerated to persist anywhere along the Puget sound. We will force them to flee back across the border and scrub any remnants of their presence. For generations they will sing the praises of what we accomplish here, how we liberated our homes and brought peace to the north."

 prize_of_cascadia_olympia_title: "Prize of Cascadia"
 prize_of_cascadia_olympia_desc: "Capital of Cascadia, the most beautiful city in all Washingtons, Seattle has fallen into the hands of a bitter enemy. As a term of the peace between the Napan president and the red menace of Alaska, Seattle would become an independent vassal state. The issue of the city’s independence would be renegotiated at a later date. Despite this, it seems that the Alaskans have begun to slowly take more and more rights from the Alaskan in a worrying escalation. We must liberate our brothers in the capital and claim its significance for ourselves."

 currying_favor_olympia_title: "Currying Favor"
 currying_favor_olympia_desc: "Through careful diplomatic maneuvers, our nation has successfully managed to fill in a niche as the president’s representative in Washington. The electorate of Helens was given their title in large part due to their traditionalist sympathies. While they have remained lukewarm on the new Napan administration, we have earnestly supported all of the president’s aims. We must deepen these ties and use them to bolster our position in the Union."

 northern_classicalism_olympia_title: "Northern Classicalism"
 northern_classicalism_olympia_desc: "Classicalism is first and foremost a Libertarian movement. The most prominent Classicalist painters originated from Fresno, San Francisco, and Sacramento. The most prominent Classicalist authors placed their narratives in the hills of Big Sur and farms of the Joaquin. While the south flourished in its appreciation of the arts, a small collection of artists and playwrights in Washington created works which would define the region for the next century. These pieces which highlighted the natural beauty of Cascadia were considered to be part of Northern Classicalism."
 upstaging_the_competition_olympia_title: "Upstaging the Competition"
 upstaging_the_competition_olympia_desc: "Theatre has long been a niche form of artistic expression in the west. The ancient Sacramental plays never really stuck with the Californians. In Olympia, a handful of playwrights and actors in the 17th century established a unique form of theater completely detached from the familiar form of the east. Expressions were more subtle, the writing more grounded, and the theaters themselves more cramped. The audience was placed closer to the stage so that they might more deeply observe the actor’s craft. The scripts would praise traditionally Classicalist values like scholarship and creativity. As the Cascadian revolution rippled throughout Washington and Arborea, the tales told in these plays inspired the cultural values of the new Cascadian identity."

 olympia_events.1.t: "Olympic Blunder"
 olympia_events.1.d: "Through some terrible twist of fate we have lost control of the Olympic Peninsula. The territory was awarded to us for our successful conquest of Washington during The Northern War. Our continued presence in the area was a necessary component of our Californian expansion. We must strike back at the nation which stole it from us or look elsewhere in order to regain a foothold in the region."
 olympia_events.1.a: "Horrror!"
 olympia_events.2.t: "Cascadian Futures"
 olympia_events.2.d: "The future of Cascadian commerce is looking bright as we claim more of the region and improve the territory that we hold. Our newly created merchant fleet and recent dominance of the Salish sea affords us a chance to define the future of the region’s trade. There are three paths forward that will enrich our nation. We could choose to focus on boosting the royal coffers with our earnings, taking the lion’s share of any profits gained by domestic merchants for ourselves. Alternatively, if we invest some of the profits into improving the Olympic peninsula it could potentially grant us greater gains in the long run. Even further, we could focus on empowering the traders themselves. The next generation of entrepreneurs may see the success of their forefathers and work with us to further the gains of our realm."

 olympia_events.3.d: "Our recent alliance with the Olympian state has apparently embolden them to make some lofty claims. According to their [U55.Monarch.GetTitle], the small realm plans on challenging the Alaskans in the region. This message has spread throughout the Union congress and deepened many of the prince’s faith in our presidency. Let us hope that they make good on their promise."
 olympia_events.3.a: "We shall see."
 olympia_events.4.t: "Olympian Stageplays"
 olympia_events.4.d: "Theatre has become a large part of our realm’s national spirit. The tales portrayed on those grand stages have written themselves into the very soul of our community. Writers from throughout America now venture to our cities and collaborate together to make art which enriches our people. The talent, the artistry, and the creativity have placed our nation on a pedestal compared to all others that surround us. Foreign nobles long to be in our courts, wander our countryside, and pray within our churches. Some among our court have suggested that we use this newfound influence to bolster our government. The process will take time, but by the end we should be able to use this great cultural power to enact our aims."
 olympia_events.4.a: "Interesting"

 olympia_events.5.t: "Strong Sense of Self"
 olympia_events.5.d: "Outside, under the shade of evergreen trees, all are joined in the oaken seats of the theater. Whether you are a pauper or a prince, everyone is asked to gather and observe the tales of the day. Our efforts to utilize our realm’s expertise in the artform have begun to pay off as many in our nation have become more accommodating to our administration’s goals. So many generations of new talented scholars and artists have devoted their lives to teaching the lessons of our national spirit. The bureaucrats and lords of our government have doubled their efforts out of inspiration from those words spoken on stage. Even the general masses have begun to live their lives like those acted out in front of them."

 olympia_events.5.c: "The Masses Change their Ways"
 olympia_events.6.t: "Mavis and Sons"
 olympia_events.6.d: "The Enlightenment brought with it a rebirth of Classical ideas throughout most of California. The Northern Theatre movement of Olympia had been distinguishing itself from the stuffy old plays of the east for over a century already when the famed traveling show “Mavis and Sons” began its tours. The collection of over thirty actors from the city took what had been a local practice across the continent. Performing for foreign presidents and emperors, Mavis and Sons helped to spread Cascadian culture across the globe. Mavis Nelson, founder of the company, held strong ties to the Cascadian liberation movement and used his influence to get foreign support for the nation’s independence. In 1758 he was appointed as the Secretary of State of the new Cascadian republic, a post which he held until his death in 1765."
