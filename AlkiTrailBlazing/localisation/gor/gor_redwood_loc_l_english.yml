 redwood_brutality_redwood_order: "Redwood Brutality"
 redwood_brutality_redwood_order_desc: "The city streets are clean. The shops open and close on time. Markets are orderly and goods rarely go missing. The Order’s swift blade of justice constantly hangs over the citizenry. Tales of the brutality in Oregon have instilled a deep sense of fear among those under the order, so that no one is brave enough to act out. There are few acts of resistance, for the price of resistance is certain death."
 authority_of_the_justicar_redwood_order: "Authority Of The Justicar"
 authority_of_the_justicar_redwood_order_desc: "Our glorious Founder does not play favorites. While the President is His supreme representation on this Earth, He occasionally selects other individuals to play important roles. There have been many justicars selected throughout history. Our state has the elevated status of being brought into being by one of the most famous: Dolson Rogue. This status bestows our engagement in Union politics with a certain tinge of good will, allowing us to get away with far more aggressive actions than otherwise possible."
 coastal_aristocracy_redwood_order: "Coastal Aristocracy"
 coastal_aristocracy_redwood_order_desc: "Among the main classes of Jefferson are those who linger along the coast and get fat off the trade which flows up to Alaska. This Redwood Aristocracy passed down generations upon generations of their wealth to their descendants, creating a little paradise among the predominantly rural Jefferson. They remain completely loyal to the Order, mutually reliant upon its stability and unity to keep their wealth in check."
 founders_fervor_redwood_order: "Founder's Fervor"
 founders_fervor_redwood_order_desc: "Thousands of sons of this sublime order flock to Crescent City each year in order to fight for its cause. Those who carry the flag of the order fight on behalf of the Founder himself. Each and every one of them fights with a fervor unparalleled by other armies. While other soldiers always have the nagging idea in the back of their minds that their wars are all for the profit of some duke, ours can be assured that they only fight in wars with divine interests."
 a_martial_people_redwood_order: "A Martial People"
 a_martial_people_redwood_order_desc: "Almost every member of our state is ready for conquest. This policy began with the invasion of Oregon, our citizens prepared for a counter offensive which never came. They battened down their houses and assembled into local defense groups. From the Justicar down, they are all ready to raise arms in defense of Jefferson. We can draw upon them at any time to fill our ranks."
 smoke_and_smiths_redwood_order: "Smoke and Smiths"
 smoke_and_smiths_redwood_order_desc: "The brightest among our nation also have their eyes tilted towards the cutting edge of military technology since its founding. We were among the first in the Union to to import that black powder from the Oaxacans, the first to fine steel from pig iron, and the first to learn from the talent of the Lafayettes in the east. Even now, the air above us is littered with smoke and the clanging of hammer against metal, ushering in a new age of warfare."
 redwood_companies_redwood_order: "Redwood Companies"
 redwood_companies_redwood_order_desc: "Ever since ancient times, the waters along the Redwood coast have served as a valuable stopping place on the waves to the north. Crescent City was originally founded as a place for traders to rest, have a good meal, and unload some cargo. Now the entire economy of the coast is geared towards accommodating these traders, a task made difficult by the embargo of the Union on the Alaskans."
