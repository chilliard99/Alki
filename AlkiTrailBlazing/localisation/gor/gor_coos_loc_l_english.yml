 coos_ideas: "Cooser Ideas"
 freedom_lovers_coos: "Freedom Lovers"
 freedom_lovers_coos_desc: "Our nation was founded on one fundamental promise, that every man no matter his wealth or creed, would be allowed to barter free from the prying eyes of the state. Our citizens have come to expect this treatment from us and, in turn, have been more forgiving of our mistakes in governance."
 in_pursuit_of_wealth_coos: "In Pursuit Of Wealth"
 in_pursuit_of_wealth_coos_desc: "The Constitution expressly states that every soul is to be granted three fundamental rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Us Freedonians believe that there is no greater good than the pursuit of this happiness; a task which is most easily done by amassing earthly riches. It is our duty as a model example to our citizens to fill our coffers to the gills. Unfurl the sails and ready every able bodied sailor, these goods aren’t going to move themselves!"
 redwood_allies_coos: "Redwood Allies"
 redwood_allies_coos_desc: "The Coos Organization grew from a small collection of local artisans and merchants to a sovereign corporation in just five short years. They were founded in 1428 by a series of nobles who fled the new Oregonian republic. They settled in Crescent City and used their influence in Coos to ship goods to the Redwood front. Battle weary soldiers came to cherish Tuesdays when their transports would arrive with fresh food and new arms from the south. This admiration slowly spread and eventually led the Redwood Grandmaster to officially assimilate them into the Order in the summer of 1431. In the aftermath of the war, those nobles who originally fled Coos in the first place offered to take over management of the city. Seeing no other reasonable replacements, the Coos Corporation was formed."
 sandy_dunes_coos: "Sandy Dunes"
 sandy_dunes_coos_desc: "Next to where the sea meets land, but too expansive to be a simple beach, the Coos Sand Dunes stretch out like lumps of dough into the horizon. The bizarre site manages to confuse all those who visit, but we’ve gotten used to their mismatched character. We have lived among the dunes and know all of their secrets. Should any enemy attempt to step foot on that beloved sandy terrain our armies will have the distinct advantage."
 fortify_coos_bay_coos: "Fortify Coos Bay"
 fortify_coos_bay_coos_desc: "Our home is protected by the dunes and the shores, yet some merchants still fear foreign invasion. Perhaps one day the Redwoods in the south will tire of our existence and march north to destroy us. We must devote our time to expanding our existing fortifications and hiring more soldiers to staff the garrison so that we may be ready for anything."
 red_berries_coos: "Red Berries"
 red_berries_coos_desc: "Along the bay and in shallow waters, our farmers grow a particularly tart berry which has become a favorite among former Redwood soldiers. For generations a few Coosers families have grown a yearly cranberry crop and pressed the red fruit into juice and wine. They spread this tart good during the Redwood campaign, wherein the Coos organization would ship barrels of the berries and their juice further north to the front. Captains and common soldiers alike became addicted to the little red berries over the course of their conquest. Now these families make a good living drying their product and shipping it south to Jefferson."
 those_lost_children_coos: "Those Lost Children"
 those_lost_children_coos_desc: "Like most other nations around these parts, we are continuing to suffer from the extremist Sons of Oregon. While they are certainly more tolerant of our administration than the more tyrannical types to our north, they have nonetheless demanded that we cease our profit motives and allow their types to take over. We must be ever vigilant of their attempts to usurp our rule."

 coorperate_republic_reform: "Corporate Republic"
 coorperate_republic_reform_desc: "A republic led by a corporate board, each member of which owns a share of the country’s total profits. A CEO is elected from among members of the board to guide the nation in matters of military and administration. Beyond this light touch, almost all other aspects of life under a Corporate Republic are guided by the individual."

 nurturing_the_economy_coos_title: "Nurturing The Economy"
 nurturing_the_economy_coos_desc: "An economy is like a well maintained lawn. Too little attention and it will become a jungle. Too much cutting and the grass will never grow. We must strike a gentle balance of taxation and incentives to ensure that our economy can turn into something lush and bountiful."
 invite_foreign_investors_coos_title: "Invite Foreign Investors"
 invite_foreign_investors_coos_desc: "Our corporation is lacking the necessary capital that it needs to expand. Too much competition and a few big fish are ruining the pond. We need new blood. Reach out to the wealthiest lords of the Union and invite them to our state. Hopefully they will see the opportunity for revenue and sign onto our prosperous venture."

 gospel_of_greed_coos_title: "Gospel of Greed"
 gospel_of_greed_coos_desc: "The Constitution teaches that the most divine pursuit of man is that of happiness. What makes one happier than money? These are the types of lessons we should be teaching within the houses of The Founder, not any of the morals of Traditionalists or Progressives. We would be wise to invest in a set of corporate backed churches or cathedrals that promote our gospel of wealth so that our citizens are inspired to improve their valuation."

 open_investment_coos_title: "Open Investment"
 open_investment_coos_desc: "We have bore the burden of expansion for too long. We are all in this partnership together, but sometimes it feels as if our citizens don’t even care. Let us demonstrate how they should invest in the national interests by beginning a plan of infrastructure development. Hopefully by the time we are done the more wealthy of our subjects will finally invest back into their communities."

 victory_of_the_market_coos_title: "Victory Of The Market"
 victory_of_the_market_coos_desc: "The reason why the President and gaggle of electors have failed so many times is because they do not have The Founder at their back. They are far too concerned with the worldly pursuit of power instead of what truly matters: money. Let us show them what the faithful can do if they are filled with the Spirit of Liberty."

 tillamook_patrol_coos_desc: "Trade along the Pacific provides most of our corporation’s value. Any foreign power with a larger fleet than us could seriously disrupt the economy and cause a recession. We must invest part of our earnings in a corporate fleet to protect this weakness and continue to expand our commercial influence."

 sellsword_army_coos_title: "Sellsword Army"
 sellsword_army_coos_desc: "Our citizens would be better off chasing profits rather than throwing away their lives in wars. Should we find a need to expand our political influence, we ought to rely on foreign soldiers to fill our armies. Put a call out to the war wise of this great Union, tell them there is a good profit to be made exerting the will of our board abroad!"
 cashcadians_coos_title: "Caschcadians"
 cashcadians_coos_desc: "When other nations look at the Cascades they see a barrier. We see opportunity. Every part of their prized trees will serve our navy. The tar underneath their bark will harden our wood against the elements and the timber that stretches them into the skies will carry us across the waves. Even if we don’t use the goods ourselves, we can sell them to the highest bidder at an exorbitant price."
 fromage_finances_coos_title: "Fromage Finances"
 fromage_finances_coos_desc: "The cheese industry of Tillamook would fare much better under our hands. As it stands the Cheeselords and Count of Astoria are constantly in a cat and mouse game for control over the profits. We should conquer the lands and offer the Cheeselords an opportunity to buy into the corporation, that way we can share in their success and encourage further growth."

 golden_river_coos_title: "Golden River"
 golden_river_coos_desc: "The richest area of Oregon has historically lied along the Willamette river. Control of its banks must be the utmost priority to continue our steady growth. After our conquests of the river we could consolidate our territories and finally deal with the Sons of Oregon. Removing them from our state will go far in offsetting loss from rebellion and their shady actions."

 bending_the_banks_coos_desc: "Bend is in the ideal position to serve as our forward offices for the Inland Empire trade. Our contacts in the area suggest that many of the local lords would be willing to join up with the board, given that we allow them preferential treatment. Investment in their local city will no doubt be enough to get them on our side. With their management of the lands along the Bend river, the area will hopefully embrace our leadership with ease."

 the_executives_claws_coos_title: "The Executive Claws"
 the_executives_claws_coos_desc: "During The War of the Mad, a group of shellfishermen from Coos Bay traveled to the front to help push back the Republicans. They became famous during the Battle of Eugene when they infiltrated the city’s fort by pretending to be a group of chefs. Behind the enemy lines, these former sailors sabotaged the fort’s protections and opened the main gate allowing the Redwood armies to rush in. When they met with the general outside of the fort, they came bearing gifts of lobsters and crabs which they had supposedly cooked in the fort’s kitchen. These ridiculous actions led to their outfit being named the “Crabbies.” After the war, many returned back home and took on higher up positions within the new Coos Corporation. Let us use their war wisdom to educate the next generation of soldiers and generals in the art of combat."
 corporate_expansion_coos_title: "Corporate Expansion"
 corporate_expansion_coos_desc: "A bigger nation will be able to conduct bigger business. Bigger business leads to bigger profits. It's basic economics. If we wish to enrich our citizenry and improve our valuation we will need to conquer new territories. There are many states that surround us, even more of which have larger armies or wealthier cities than our own. Yet, our victory against them is assured because they lack a dedication to success."

 vinyard_ventures_coos_title: "Vinyard Ventures"
 vinyard_ventures_coos_desc: "There is no industry more profitable in Oregon than the Willamette wines. Their status is only surpassed by those further south in Napa. The only reason that the Libertarian wine rains supreme is because of the local vintner's lack of conviction. All of their profits end up going to their local lords rather than remaining with them. We must buy them into our company so that they can finally enjoy the fruits of their labor."

 crooked_capital_coos_title: "Crooked Capital"
 crooked_capital_coos_desc: "Despite the mostly barren status of Morrow-Crook, the area is home to some of the richest individuals in Oregon. During the days of the Republic, many wealthy nobles fled east fearing that their wealth would be taken by radicals. While some traveled all the way to the Snake river and founded Echo, others stood their ground. Surprisingly, they were offered a welcoming hand by the Republic who actually had lighter taxes than their previous lords. Adding these wealthy individuals to our board may help us to fund some of our more expensive endeavors."

 coos_events.1.t: "Exactly How Free?"
 coos_events.1.d: "Freedonians are not monolithic. There are many among us who believe that any control on a market amounts to heresy, while others simply believe that all citizens should be on a level playing field. The blind faith of otherwise talented advisors makes finding the best solution to commercial issues like these quite difficult. Sometimes it is hard to tell if an advisor believes what they do because of its effectiveness or some sort of religious belief. The passions behind these devotions have made it nearly impossible to create a concrete solution to the management of equity under our firm. Some of our own citizens have taken up The Founder’s goal of encouraging prosperity and have petitioned for a stop to taxation on their profits. As it stands, we have minor taxes on each citizen and gain most of our money from the general population by owning a share of their production. From here we have three paths. First, we could raise the rate of taxation and sell off all of our shares in citizen corporations. This way we do not have more interest in any particular ventures. Alternatively, we could further diversify our holdings by giving a minimum investment in any firm founded by our citizens that meets certain requirements. Even further, we could abolish the tax system overall and rely solely on the profits generated from our own holdings to fund the state. Whatever our choice, we must ensure that all members of the board receive their proper compensation and are dutifully informed."
