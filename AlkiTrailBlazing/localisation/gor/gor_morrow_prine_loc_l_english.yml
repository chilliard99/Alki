 not_quite_far_enough_morrow: "Not Quite Far Enough"
 not_quite_far_enough_morrow_desc: "Just shy of a decade ago, these lands were even more sparse than they are today. The majority of the inhabitants of Morrow and Prine arrived from the west, fleeing the burgeoning Oregonian Republic. Wealthy families feared that this new regime would attempt to seize their lands and enforce some sort of peasant revolution among their lower ranks. Instead, they found that the Republic was actually more accommodating than their previous lords. While many packed their bags and headed back home, some of the nobles remained in Morrow and Crook due to the escalating tensions along the Jeffersonian border. This has led to our state being primarily led by various nobles whose influence rivals that of the duke."
 wheat_wisdom_morrow: "Wheat Wisdom"
 wheat_wisdom_morrow_desc: "The Oregonian Agricultural College was founded in the 12th century by members of the Three Star’s League, a trade organization founded to combat the influence of Washingtonian barons. This college’s primary purpose was the study of grown goods and nature itself. Their extensive investigations confirmed the findings of foreign farmers that leaving part of the field fallow each year could lead to more consistent harvests. The institution continues its studies into the modern day, albeit to a lesser extent."
 port_morrow_morrow: "Port Morrow"
 port_morrow_morrow_desc: "The three major Columbian river ports lie at Vancouver, The Dalles, and the Tri-cities. Outside of these three there are a smattering of smaller settlements that constantly vie for control of the river’s commerce. Among the most prominent of these minor cities lies in the province of Gillam at Boardman. “Port Morrow” began construction under the Oregonian Republic in an effort to encourage traders to settle in the east. The Redwood Campaign left the port mainly untouched, after which it was promptly completed by the Heppeners. Its grand status has attracted traders across the Inland Empire. Some speculative investors have even begun to develop the city further, believing that it may soon rise to the level of the rest of the major ports."
 heppners_old_job_morrow: "Heppner's Old Job"
 heppners_old_job_morrow_desc: "There are rulers which spark more outrage in the Union than Josh Heppner. Heppner was once part of the Sons of Oregon during its early days. Back then, the organization was founded as a means to continue the good fight of the Republic after their major leaders had been arrested at Bend. Heppner led a bitter campaign of resistance against the incoming Redwood invaders, but soon recognized the frivolous nature of his task. The peace negotiations had already begun and soon he would have to take his resistance underground. To get ahead of this, Heppner turned his back on the Sons of Oregon and sold out many of their early leaders. This move unintentionally had the effect of removing most of the moderates from the movement, leaving only extremists behind."
 staying_alive_morrow: "Staying Alive"
 staying_alive_morrow_desc: "Ever since his betrayal of the Sons of Oregon, Heppner has faced hundreds of assassination attempts. His first son, Ryan, and his wife, Carla, were both killed by members of their group. Most major public officials Heppner has hired into office face a similar fate at the hands of the rowdy rebels. This level of resistance has marginally slowed down as members of the Sons of Oregon have begun to venture east and manipulate the states of the Willamette. Regardless, our state must be ever vigilant of shadowy figures. Danger waits around every corner."
 boonie_unity_morrow: "Boonie Unity"
 boonie_unity_morrow_desc: "Before The War of the Mad and formation of the Oregonian Republic, Morrow and Crook were united into a single nation. Many assumed this state would return, much like the rest of the Oregonian nations in the west, but the influential houses of the south preventented its reemergence. Instead they advocated for the formation of two states. One would be a monarchy led by the Heppners and the other would be an oligarchy. We have long dreamed of uniting these two separate halves and restoring Morrow-Crook, yet such ventures were unpopular. This is no longer the case. As each day passes, more and more of our citizens clamor for the opportunity to join their neighbors in a united boonie state."
 counter_support_morrow: "Counter Support"
 counter_support_morrow_desc: "The Sons of Oregon were a consistent political issue for the Union throughout the 16th century, primarily due to their terroristic actions against members of the Union congress. Heppner was called before the Californians multiple times to speak about his experiences with the group and subsequently garnered a large amount of support for the cause of clamping down on their extremism. The broader political support for this movement bolstered Heppner’s rule and made him the face of Oregon for a short period."

 long_live_the_crooks_prine_desc: "The Crook family was one of the few Oregonian houses that allied itself with the Republic and survived the Redwood Campaign. This was partially due to their close ties to the Jeffersonian states in the south, a fact which they attempted to leverage into actually preventing the Redwood invasion all together. In the aftermath of the war, the Crooks argued for the creation of an independent oligarchy out of the city of Prineville. Ever since the republic’s foundation, the Crook family has held power."
 ochoco_prine: "Ochoco"
 ochoco_prine_desc: "Among the mountains of Morrow-Crook there lies a majestic forest which dazzles all those who gaze upon its expansive form. The Ochoco has served our state well in providing materials for our buildings and river crafts. It provides a steady source of income for lumberjacks who sell the wood to Columbian traders. River barges stacked high with logs float their way to the Pacific to be used on Cascadian vessels."
 rockhounds_prine: "Rockhounds"
 rockhounds_prine_desc: "A popular profession among the poor of Crook is the collection of smell gems. Traveling across the countryside one can find all manner of rocks filled with dazzling beauty when cracked open. These are often sold to Theanites in the east to be used in their various rituals. Those that make a living out of gathering the crystals are known as Rockhounds for their tenacity in sniffing out which pebbles are worth something and which are useless."
 ancient_relics_prine: "Ancient Relics"
 ancient_relics_prine_desc: "Prineville is home to the private collection of the Crook family. Within their hoard is a variety of historical Californian artifacts that vary in age from a couple centuries old to preceding the American empire. The Crook Collection has caused a few controversies over the years, mostly centering on the Franciscan family’s attempt to force the Crooks into handing over some of the more politically significant artifacts."
 oligarchy_hoards_prine: "Oligarchy Hoards"
 oligarchy_hoards_prine_desc: "While we are a state of Crooks first and foremost, there are some other noble families within our state that have used their influence to buy a seat at the table of governance. Their generous contributions to our republic ensure that we can continue to pursue prosperity for the citizenry and defend our people against foreign threats. The glut of wealth hoarded for centuries by their ancestors will much better serve the interests of our republic rather than sitting in a vault somewhere collecting dust."
 jeffersonian_connections_prine: "Jeffersonian Connections"
 jeffersonian_connections_prine_desc: "Stephen Crook was a close ally of the Napan President. He led the Southern Jeffersonian Army, a small detachment of soldiers that went south to confront the Mad President directly in Kernifornia. The two became close friends fighting side by side, which granted Stephen a lot of influence when peacetime came around. He was originally going to be given the office of elector, but the Traditionalists refused this request unless he committed to their party. We’ve held close ties to the resulting duchy of Goose and relied upon their support more than once in suppressing the Sons of Oregon."
 boonie_brotherhood_prine: "Boonie Brotherhood"
 boonie_brotherhood_prine_desc: "The lands of Morrow and Crook were once united into a single duchy before the formation of the Oregonian Republic and Redwood Campaign. A return to this state’s rule was expected by many following the war, yet the area was split into two different states due to our influence. It was obvious that that Sons of Oregon sympathizer in the north, Josh Heppner, would usher in an age of noble suppression. We are not opposed to unity between our two states, in fact many in our republic wish to stand side by side with their boonie neighbors, yet Heppner’s tyrannical rule would be the death of our houses. Perhaps one day we may reunite under a glorious republic led by a wise council of land owners, but until that day let us defend our republic from the threat in our north."

 wealth_before_power_morrow_crook_desc: "Our nation is founded on the premise that our administration should serve the interests of the nobility. We should endeavor to not overreach into their own lands and micromanage their estates. The land owners know better than anyone else what the serf needs. Collaboration with their ranks will lead us to succeed in all aspects of government. In turn, our assistance with their needs will elevate their wealth to degrees unimaginable by the oppressed rabble of the west."
 lord_of_the_east_morrow_crook: "Lord of The East"
 lord_of_the_east_morrow_crook_desc: "Through careful expansion we have managed to unite all of east Oregon under the banner of Morrow-Crook. Nations across the Union have recognized this change in the balance of power and will likely soon call for dissolution or coalition. If we wish to further spread our borders, it might be wise to do it through a network of vassals and client states rather than direct annexation. Whatever our path forward, we can take pride in our current progress and look forward towards a future in which all of Oregon lives under our rule."
 blank_slate_morrow_crook: "Blank Slate"
 blank_slate_morrow_crook_desc: "Unlike the ruined lands of the Willamette, the Oregonian boonies were spared from complete destruction. This was mostly due to the area’s sparse population. When the Redwoods arrived in our lands, there was little for them to actually tear down. While this has certainly had its downsides, the lack of any real existing infrastructure has provided our nation with the opportunity to start fresh. We can use cutting edge architectural techniques and the wisdom of past planners to create a civilization in east Oregon worth envying."
 john_day_morrow_crook: "John Day"
 john_day_morrow_crook_desc: "While not as important or bountiful as the Deschutes or Willamette river, the John Day river is vital for our state’s function. Salmon from the river is a staple food among the citizens of our state. The water from its length is corralled into farms in order to hydrate the soil. Small vessels even use the river for transporting goods to the Columbia, though this is nowhere as extensive as Deschutes transportation. It should be our administration’s endeavor to preserve the river and make use of its bountiful status to continue to promote prosperity."
 imperial_domination_morrow_crook: "Imperial Domination"
 imperial_domination_morrow_crook_desc: "Our vital ports along the Columbia river have given our state a cutting edge in the Inland Empire market. Unlike the Echoites, we do not need to pay Union tariffs when carrying goods from the Plainwalkers. This status has already attracted attention from some of the wiser Union investors who have poured buckets of ducats into developing ports at Boardman and Arlington. With further grit, it is undoubtable that our nation could take a leading role in the Inland Empire markets and perhaps even dominate all Union trade east of The Dalles."
 union_influence_morrow_crook: "Union Influence"
 union_influence_morrow_crook_desc: "It turns out that having a state composed primarily of Old Money nobles has its benefits. The cumulative connections of all of their houses gives us unimaginable insight into the Union’s current status. A quick conversation with one of our citizens could prevent a war along the Joaquin or sway a vote in the Union congress. It is vital that we keep this card close to our chest. If the other dukes find out what level of influence we have over their state, the consequences would be dire."
 western_march_morrow_crook: "Western March"
 western_march_morrow_crook_desc: "Oregon, now more than ever, needs a guiding influence to ensure its success into future generations. The citizens of the region have been kicked in the dust and continue to struggle in getting back up ever since their defeat during The Redwood Crusade. Someone needs to step in, repair the damage, and make Oregon a powerful part of the Union again. Looking at the potential unifiers, it seems that no nation is up to the task except us. Ready the men and tell them of our plans, it is time to add some order in the chaos."

The Progressive party has held sway over the Union for centuries, yet has been on the decline ever since The War of The Mad. While the future may lie with the Traditionalists, we must consider if this is a future we even want to be a part of. A Union dominated by their sort would be far different than the form we see today.

 morrow_crook_events.2.d: "The Sons of Oregon weren’t always the menace that we see them as today. At one time they were simply all that remained of the Oregonian Republic. Once their capital of Portland was taken, the remaining Republicans fled east, across the Cascades, to the city of Bend. They lingered there for a while until the lord of the city had their leaders arrested. Josh Heppner, a diplomat who had attempted to negotiate an alliance with the Echoites in the east, rose up and guided a handful of the remaining forces east into the lands of Morrow and Crook. There they occupied the city of Condon and readied themselves for a final confrontation with the Redwoods. He proclaimed the city of Condon to be a part of the brand new “Sons of Oregon,” an organization based on restoring the former Republic. The Redwood confrontation never came as Heppner soon realized the futility of this resistance and surrendered to the invaders. Those loyal to Heppner and the moderates followed him in surrender with the guarantee of a pardon for their crimes. All those that remained part of the organization were the most radical elements. The reason for this history lesson is that Heppner has recently reconsidered his former status as a member of their organization. The Sons of Oregon have routinely targeted the count for his betrayal long ago, but he cannot help but feel some sort of responsibility for their misguided actions. Maybe if he had stuck with them, the organization could have been a positive force. Memories of the republic still linger in his mind, haunting his dreams with reminders of the blissful joy he felt during that time. Rumors abound throughout the Union that with the newly reunited status of Morrow-Crook, Heppner may attempt to proclaim a new republic and call the Sons of Oregon into action.
