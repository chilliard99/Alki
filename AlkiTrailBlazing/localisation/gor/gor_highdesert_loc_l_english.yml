 our_arid_abode_highdesert: "Our Arid Abode"
 our_arid_abode_highdesert_desc: "For generations our people have made a living in the inhospitable steppe of the Highdesert. That vast plain has served as a barrier between Oregonians and the Nevadans since man first sprung forth from eden. So few know how to survive in the steppe, luckily we have the wisdom of hundreds of generations to ensure that we can grow in such a resistant place."
 frontier_growth_highdesert: "Frontier Growth"
 frontier_growth_highdesert_desc: "The High Oregonians emerged from a time long ago, when those who resisted the civilizing influence of the Californias fled east and settled along the Snake river. Our population once stretched from Boise to just shy of Black Rock, but soon the “civilized” men came to corral us into smaller and smaller communities. Day by day their settlers come to the frontier and chip away at our control over the land. If we wish to preserve our traditions into the future we will need to follow in their footsteps and improve the desert."
 deschutes_caravans_highdesert: "Deschutes Caravans"
 deschutes_caravans_highdesert_desc: "Due to our ability to brave the heat and sparse lands of the Highdesert we can always rely upon the caravans for income. Occasionally, traders from Nevada will need goods transferred quickly to the rivers of the north. For that they enlist our services. A wrangler can make it across the desert in just a few days, a task that might take an army over a week to accomplish. Larger loads are carried in caravans which are generally family run operations. As the sole provider of this sort of service, we carry a lot of influence over quick trade in the Inland Empire market."
 wrangler_dragoons_highdesert: "Wrangler Dragoons"
 wrangler_dragoons_highdesert_desc: "As we continue to modernize our state to meet up with the rest of the world, our Wranglers have taken a liking to gunpowder weapons. Marksman training has become a routine part of Wrangler culture and the sight of one of their brown hats strikes fear into the hearts of our enemies. It is said that their accuracy is such that a Wrangler charging across a battlefield could pinpoint and shoot the wedding band off of an enemy soldier’s finger from a distance of 400 paces."
 service_titles_highdesert: "Service Titles"
 service_titles_highdesert_desc: "Our state has come up with an ingenious way of ensuring that we always have willing soldiers to fill our ranks. In exchange for victory in combat, soldiers will be granted titles and a portion of the land conquered. You will never see true fury until you have seen a pauper fight for a chance to become a rich man. After they become nobles, this class of new money will also be extremely loyal to our rule, thankful for the opportunities we have afforded them."
 march_to_the_coast_highdesert: "March To The Coast"
 march_to_the_coast_highdesert_desc: "For far too long have the Oregonains beyond the Cascades dominated the conversation. The riches of their cities deserve to serve our interests. They misuse The Founder’s blessings to get drunk and promote radicalism. Gather the horses and recall the wranglers from their herds, it is time to teach these pompous westerns how we make war in the Highdesert."
 anarchist_defense_highdesert: "Anarchist Defense"
 anarchist_defense_highdesert_desc: "The President, that fool, has let heresy fester in their own backyard. These “Anarchists” believe that The Founder takes active involvement in the affairs of petty mortals. They doubt the very premise of rule, that any one man can hold more of The Spirit of Liberty within them than another! We will not let such thoughts pollute our pious state. If the President will not do something about these heretics, we will meet them with the fires of righteousness."

Rather than fight its slow embrace and face death at the hands of progress, we have decided to fight back and embrace development in whole. We will turn this desert into an oasis in this Californian wasteland. All will soon turn their eyes to the Highdesert for enlightenment!"

 taming_the_desert_highdesert_desc: "We have created wondrous cities out of our arid expanse, now we must carve up the landscape in order to support our growing populations. First and foremost we must find consistent sources of water. There are a few rivers that run close to our borders, but we should endeavor to construct many wells so that we can have something closer to home. To truly attract the attention of the rest of the world we must found a mighty city, one that can rival the status of those in liberty."

 orrian_caravans_highdesert_title: "Orrian Caravans"
 orrian_caravans_highdesert_desc: "Long ago our merchants were trusted to carry gold from the lands of Orria into the rest of the north. When the Orrian state fell, the Utahns exchanged our services for those of merchants along the Snake river. This valuable income can be regained again if we claim our own gold resources. With enough production in our own borders we can inflate the northern markets and make the Utahns take on a more eastern outlook."

 press_into_portland_highdesert_title: "Press Into Portland"
 press_into_portland_highdesert_desc: "Nowhere is the ungrateful attitude of the Oregonians clearer than in the city of Portland. The Founder gave man his mind to tame the natural world and make his own way among its many dangers. For some this is easier, much easier if you are some city slicker from the Willamette, yet the radicals of Portland have decided they would rather tear everything down. We will not let the beauty of civilization fall to ash, we must liberate Portland and slaughter these heretics."

 redwood_restoration_highdesert_title: "Redwood Restoration"
 redwood_restoration_highdesert_desc: "The War Of The Mad never came to our borders, though our wranglers were among the many that died in the bloody battles for Orria. Oregon was not as lucky. The way we heard it, the entire region was wiped out by the Redwood Order. As we march through their cities we can see this ruin. Now that we have united all of them under our reign, we must begin the task of restoring these cities to their former glory."

 parched_presidency_highdesert_desc: "We have grown to such a status that demands we make an attempt for the Presidency. While we doubt that we may get any sort of wider attention, there is always a chance that the clouded minds of the college come to their senses and see our value. Until that time we will wait and continue to expand till we reach their doorsteps."

 lincolnite_centers_highdesert_desc: "Never before in their lives have our soldiers seen such majesty as the plains of Lincoln. At first they believed the place to be just like our home, a yellow land full of dry dust, but on their approach they realized that they were in the midst of vast farmlands. To secure our growing population we must claim the most prosperous of these centers and spread these valuable grains to all who may soon go hungry."

 invest_in_the_highdesert_highdesert_title: "Invest In The Highdesert"
 invest_in_the_highdesert_highdesert_desc: "To begin our move towards civilization, we must first build up the Highdesert to reflect its neighbors. Clearing the initial lands and learning to develop in such an arid world will be difficult, but the lessons we learn in this initial step will pay dividends down the line. Gather the most skilled craftsmen of our society and inform them of their task, no doubt they will rise to the occasion and quickly solve this challenge."

No matter how much we expand our state or become entrapped within the civilized man’s world we wish to remember this fact. Monuments to The Founder’s glory should dot the countryside, so that no one rider can take a day's travel without a reminder of The Almighty. In civilization and all its work we will find a greater appreciation for His gifts."

 hydration_innovations_highdesert_title: "Hydration Innovations"
 hydration_innovations_highdesert_desc: "The number one limiting resource to the Highdesert’s expansion at this point is water. There are few rivers which run through the region and even fewer natural sources of water. Rather than carrying more water from the Snake or Deschutes rivers, we should instead learn to use less of what we already have. Let us put the brightest minds of our nation on the task and see what type of inventions they can come up with."
 oregons_outback_highdesert_title: "Oregon's Outback"
 oregons_outback_highdesert_desc: "Those of the west have often referred to our nation as “Oregon’s Outback” in reference to the continent across the waves of the same name. We have taken on this moniker, not for the desolate nature it was originally intended to mean, but due to the promise of a frontier. The outback stands as the border of the possible and the impossible. To make a life along its difficult terrain a person must hold a tenacity stronger than the world itself. Through raising wondrous cities out of the dust, we have shown this type of tenacity a thousand times over."

 follow_the_deschutes_highdesert_title: "Follow The Deschutes"
 follow_the_deschutes_highdesert_desc: "From The Dalles to Bend, the Deschutes river binds Oregon to Jefferson as one the most important tributaries of the Columbia. Though it is far from our home in the south, if we were to take control of its course we could use caravans to transfer water all the way back to our growing cities in the Highdesert. Perhaps even more important than this, taking control of key trading cities along the Deschutes will allow us to enter into the Cascadian market with a bang."

 cascadian_conquest_highdesert_desc: "Centuries ago, our ancestors fled east across the Cascades to avoid the tide of Californian settlers from the coast. We exchanged freedom for civility. For such a long time we made nomadic lives along the steppe. It is our duty to march back between those crests and once again greet the cities of our ancestors. Send messengers forth to those in the Willamette, tell them we are coming home!"

 challenge_the_elector_highdesert_title: "Challenge The Elector"
 challenge_the_elector_highdesert_desc: "The Oregonians fought tooth and nail to get the electorate. Their soldiers died en masse for the opportunity of freedom we longed for just a short while ago. It turns out that their seat at the table came with its very own pair of chains. Shackled to the whims of the Union, the Oregonians will never truly be free until they learn to embrace their own identity. To break them free of their shackles, we will need to remove that devilish representative of the President that still lingers in our borders."
 greeting_the_waves_highdesert_title: "Greeting The Waves"
 greeting_the_waves_highdesert_desc: "It's not surprising to learn that few of our soldiers have ever seen the sea. With so much of their lives spent corralling livestock on the steppe, few have even seen a river bigger than a simple stream. If we wish to be seen as a major power on the world stage we will need to learn how to master the sea and use its connections to expand our influence abroad."
 reign_in_the_westerners_highdesert_title: "Reign In The Westerners"
 reign_in_the_westerners_highdesert_desc: "Just as we had left our western brothers centuries ago, we have returned and come to lord over them. We are grateful that they stayed behind and took the brunt of the Presidential oppression from us. Now that we are whole once again, some among our state are wondering what division still exists among our people. It seems that our embrace of civilization has done away with much of our nomadic traditions. Perhaps we are not as different as we think."
 every_prov_wit_org_in_org_auto_unrest_and_we_own_highdesert: "Every province in the Oregon region has the following:\n     Owned by §Y[Root.GetName]§!\n     Local Autonomy is below §Y30.0%§!\n    Unrest is below §Y2§!"
 her_own_wings_highdesert_title: "Her Own Wings"
 her_own_wings_highdesert_desc: "A phrase in a dead tongue has been preserved among the Oregonian: Alis Volat Propriis. Translated it means “She flies with her own wings.” For a while the untranslated version of it served as the rallying cry of their republic which led the phrase to be banned by the occupying Redwoods. It has made a resurgence among those calling for Oregonian unity under the President’s supervision. We have finally fulfilled this dream, though not under the circumstances they would have envisioned, and brought all Oregonian people under one banner. It is finally time for her to fly and soar to the heavens on her own wings."

 silence_the_sound_highdesert_desc: "Washington’s historic capital lies along the Puget sound on the coast. The cities of Seattle, Everett, and Tacoma would be perfect additions to our state. Their beauty is evenly matched with their strong maritime tradition, a facet we are severely lacking in. With their guidance our navy can become something enviable."
 seat_of_the_presidents_highdesert_title: "Seat Of The Presidents"
 seat_of_the_presidents_highdesert_desc: "From humble beginnings as simple nomads we have come to dominate nearly the entirety of the Californias. For every second of that journey we have fought to be seen with legitimacy. Our less noble origins have consistently led nations to doubt our commitment to this aim. They believed we would quickly collapse to coalition and internal strife. This could not be further from the truth. We have grown to rival the ancient Californian states of old, yet we will never truly be able to claim to be their successors until we take the capital of all Californians, seat of the eternal Presidency, the city of San Francisco."
 mechanized_wranglin_highdesert_title: "Mechanized Wranglin'"
 mechanized_wranglin_highdesert_desc: "Rearing control of a steer as wild as the Highdesert has not been an easy task. We need more than just physical muscle to make this steppe into something profitable. The mode of production of our day is manufacturing. We must litter the countryside with these mechanical wranglers so that our citizens can focus more of their time on leisure and enjoying all the prosperity we have created."

 consolidate_the_capital_highdesert_desc: "We have finally thrown off the shackles of our oppressors and united a state for the High Oregonians. For too long we have been relegated to the sidelines. It is time that the Californians come to see that we are a part of their peoples. We refuse to be seen as just some backcountry hillbillies. Raise the armies and prepare them for war. Our first steps towards becoming a true Union power begin today."
 highdeserts_end_highdesert_title: "Highdesert's End"
 highdeserts_end_highdesert_desc: "While the Highdesert is generally considered to just be the lands of the High Oregonians, its geographic bounds actually go farther north. The lands of Morrow and Crook are said to be parts of the “boonies,” an old derogatory term used by the Dachs of Washington to describe the parts of Oregon they were uninterested in. Unlike them, we see the lands of Morrow-Crook as an extension of our Highdesert. This necessitates that they come to be ruled under our glorious banner."
 wallop_walla_walla_highdesert_title: "Wallop Walla Walla"
 wallop_walla_walla_highdesert_desc: "So many out west have hatred for the Echoites. When the Union broke out in war, many of those realized that the politics and Presidential ploys were not worth the benefits of civilized society. They fled east and settled along the Snake river. We would share some sympathies with them if they hadn't repeatedly restricted the grazing lands of our Wranglers. Let us show them the true joy that can come from giving up their possessions and living off the land."

He cut a straight line across the north, according to the recounts of his generals Samson had apparently received word that this was “The Lord’s intended borders for the Californias.” Ever since this time the more Sacramentally inclined among our faith have attempted to use the border as a justification for their conflicts. We will follow them in this pattern and do the same."

The Founder intended for the Spirit of Liberty to guide man to greatness, and the President does not have a monopoly on the divine.

The Wranglers, inspired by the mythical reputation they have achieved, fight on the battlefield with a grace unforeseen in the soldiers of other nations.

Even on the border, in the city of Twin Falls, we can see evidence of Idaho’s beauty. Two grand waterfalls squeeze through bulky rocks and spill out into a great pool below.

In contrast, the Snake river and most of east Oregon has typically been seen as a backwater. Our rule from out east must signal a new age for the Oregons, one where both east and west can prosper together.

For a short period it was added into the Union as a free city, before we were forced into conflict with the Kingdom of Idaho. Conquest of the city would serve perfectly in our future expansion efforts into the rest of Idaho.

 highdesert_events.1.t: "Service Titles Program"
 highdesert_events.1.d: "To help staff our armies and ensure that we always have a steady supply of manpower, some within our military have suggested the creation of a service titles program. Under such an initiative, volunteers from our population may sign up for the military. After achieving victory in battle and conquering a portion of territory from another power, these soldiers will be granted a part of the land won. Our advisors theorize that such soldiers would fight with a fierce vigor in order to become rich men. However, some of our old money nobles predict that this will lead to problems in the future. A ballooning class of former military experts that hold huge amounts of power in our state sounds like a coup waiting to happen. Of course, they would be the main ones to object seeing as their share of the political pie is at risk. We must carefully consider whether the increase in our military capability is worth giving up a large portion of the crown’s control."

It was when the Californians arrived from the coast that this all changed. They attempted to civilize the peoples of the Willamette and force them to join them in the Californian world. We have already seen the result of this exchange, the oppression and destruction of the Oregonian people at the hands of the Redwoods. Our ancestors fled east, beyond the Cascades, into the Highdesert to make lives chasing cattle. Over time we came to settle down and civilize. Through doing this we have cast away our past identity and called into question the status of our people. Who are the High Oregonians if not those people of the steppe? What separates us now from those of the Willamette? "
