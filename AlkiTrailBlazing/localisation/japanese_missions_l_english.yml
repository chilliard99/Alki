 reclaim_the_shogun_trade_title: "Reclaim The Shogun Trade"
 reclaim_the_shogun_trade_desc: "In the days of the Reiwan the city of Tokyo and the shogun’s trade directed the flow of trade throughout the Japanese isles. Now our coffers are bare and the creeping power of the Ainu is dominating the north we might be on the cusp of a financial crisis. In order to solve this we must enact a series of trading measures, starting with reclaiming total domination of our home node."
 combat_ainu_trade_agression_title: "Protecting our Interests"
 combat_ainu_trade_agression_desc: "The next step in preventing financial collapse would be for us to create a fleet to compete with the Ainu. Even though we now can dominate our home node, the superior Ainu navy could roll in at any time and claim the riches for themselves. Constructing a number of trading vessels by themselves would not be sufficient, for in times of war the Ainu could simply disrupt our trading lifeblood. No, we must deploy a dual strategy involving a buildup of large and small crafts alike."
 the_great_port_of_tokyo_title: "Great Port of Tokyo"
 the_great_port_of_tokyo_desc: "The final step in solving our financial woes comes in the form of the central city in our home node. Just like the Reiwans before us, Tokyo has functioned as a locus for the domination of trade in the region. Ships throughout the kingdom are registered in the large city, the bureau of naval crafts constructs the lion’s share of our kingdom’s ships, and the city’s grand marketplace functions as the east coast’s premiere spot for traders. However, there are always improvements. Investing in the city's infrastructure and ports would reward us greatly and give a push towards total financial independence."
 proclaim_trading_supremacy_title: "Dominate The Waves"
 proclaim_trading_supremacy_desc: "With the city of Tokyo being expanded, our home seas being safer than ever, and the Ainu on the decline we are in the position to become the premiere trading empire not just in Nippon, not just in Japan, but in the entire world. From the shores of the Ozarks to the coasts of Newfoundland, the men of the sea will look towards the great isle in their east and turn their sails!"
 build_up_the_old_city_title: "Restore Old Tokyo"
 build_up_the_old_city_desc: "Now that we have united our brothers and sisters throughout the southern cities, it is our job to reclaim the heritage of the great Reiwans. The Reiwans were not only an expansive and noble people, but a seafaring one as well. We should embrace this tradition and head forth into the great waters in the west. In order to accomplish the great feat we first need a central base for our operations. The city of Tokyo has functioned as a centerpiece for the southern cities throughout the collapse of the daimyo, it would do us good to focus on its success."
 expand_colonial_influence_title: "Prepare for Colonization"
 expand_colonial_influence_desc: "Now that we have a central base of operations we need to invest in talented seamen who can carry civilization across the waves. The Reiwans before us had founded naval academies in the city of Chiba which they used to make contact with the people of the antilles. This school has continued to stay in function throughout the generations, so we should take advantage of its talent."
 colonize_yoroppa_title: "Colonize Yoroppa"
 colonize_yoroppa_desc: "Across the waves we have found a great open land, ready for conquest. The people of this land are primitive. Initial contact suggests that they are hostile but rich in their natural goods. This land then has to be the one rumored amongst the lips of the Greenlanders, Yoroppa. It is our duty to go forth and establish a colony on this landmass and to claim it for our great kingdom!"
 claim_forests_of_yoroppa_title: "Claim the Forests"
 claim_forests_of_yoroppa_desc: "Just like a child, we must nurture our colony as it grows. Investing in infrastructure, ports, and defense will allow it to grow into a power to rival our own. However, there are growing pains. A minor revolt here and a corrupt official there could upset our gentle balance. We need to expand! More governors, more oversight, and most importantly, more land! "
 dominate_yoroppan_hinterlands_title: "Dominate the Hinterlands"
 dominate_yoroppan_hinterlands_desc: "Beyond the lands of Odin and the Wiccan pagans we see the great many Bundesland. This land is so ripe for the taking, but first we must stake a claim in the so-called “Hinterlands” which lie on their western borders. Colonization of this land will not only ensure our domination of Yoroppa’s western half but the pivotal northern trade."
 make_contact_with_the_germans_title: "Contact the Germans"
 make_contact_with_the_germans_desc: "From our interrogation of a number of natives, we have learned that Yoroppa is not just a series of scattered tribes. Indeed there are a number of united nations in the east which could prove difficult to defeat. These Bundesland are rich beyond imagining and the strongest of the tribal yoke."
 the_heart_of_the_bundesland_title: "Heart of the Bundesland"
 the_heart_of_the_bundesland_desc: "The Bundesland is a series of united tribal kingdoms which much more closely resemble the structures of America and Mexico. The heart of their organization comes from the city of Wein, whose ruler is said to descend from a long line of divinely guided monarchs. By conquering these lands, we could shatter any legitimacy that these heathens might hold."
 assasinating_the_jutes_title: "Assasinating the Jutes"
 assasinating_the_jutes_desc: "The people of the northern Bundesland hold a maritime tradition. When our sailors originally started navigating Yoroppa’s shores, we found the remnants of Daneslander ships around every bend. From Anglia to Estonia, the impact of these sailors is present in the native culture and language. Conquering the lands of the north would allow us to cut off the Germans from escaping to the sea."
 raid_cities_of_platinum_title: "Raid Cities of Wheat"
 raid_cities_of_platinum_desc: "The heart of the Bundesland may be in the Austrian cities of the south, but the most industrially active and naturally gifted area has to be the “cities of wheat”. These cities of Saxon blood are rich with natural farmlands which the Bundesland requires for feeding its populace. Taking these lands would allow our colony to better sustain itself and starve the remaining German tribes."
 a_paradise_across_the_sea_title: "A Paradise Across the Sea"
 a_paradise_across_the_sea_desc: "Across the seas we have built a paradise to rival our own island. The great and expansive colony of Europe has room to grow into the rest of the continent. The native peoples have begun to call our colony the new Intermarium. Looking back at the history of the region, it is a fitting term. The Intermarium was a great empire which encouraged trade and built magesties upon the blank canvas of this barren land. We have tamed the wilds and make a masterpiece out of its scraps."
 claim_the_city_of_odin_title: "The City of Odin"
 claim_the_city_of_odin_desc: "Our early scouts have come upon a shocking discovery. The mythical city of Paris, the one written about in Occitanian legends of yore, lies on this new continent. The natives of the region, which our colonists have begun referring to as the legendary “gauls”, speak of an ancient god chained up in the center of the city. The Pagan God of Odin supposedly protects the city and prevented its total collapse after “the torrent.” Claiming Paris would no doubt secure our position on the continent."
 prepare_for_an_interior_invasion_title: "Prepare for Invasion"
 prepare_for_an_interior_invasion_desc: "While uniting the southern cities was certainly a great diplomatic feat, we now have to go forward and focus on military expansion. It is obvious that we wish to reform the ancient kingdom of Nippon, but the powers that stand in our way are mighty. First, the Ainu in the north wish to maintain their dominance over our fair lands. Second, the Kii and Nakatsugwans broke from our Shogun hundreds of years ago and will certainly be hostile to reintegration. Third, the recently united Hokuriku stands to potentially be a great enemy."
 reaching_across_the_isle_title: "Reacing Across The Isle"
 reaching_across_the_isle_desc: "Across the isle the Hokurikan kingdom has just breathed its first breaths after its war for independence. Not just 20 years ago the Ainu kingdom was embroiled in one of many wars for the Gulf of Saint Lawrence when the Hokurikans took the opportunity to break off. Now as the Ainu refocus their efforts on the isle it is possible that the Hokurikans could engage in a diplomatic alliance with us in order to ensure their independence. To them, our touch seems much lighter than that of the Ainu."
 the_ishikawan_breeze_title: "The Ishikawan Breeze"
 the_ishikawan_breeze_desc: "The lands of Hokuriku are not rich with industry and natural resources, but instead with the calloused hand of ancient farmers and herders. The legacy and unique identity of the area will make it difficult to unite but if we tame it we will be rewarded with unparalleled devotion. From here will have access to the Tidewater trade and the technologies of the Great Lakes. Perhaps this expansion will even grant us contact with the great Maple Throne."
 rivals_in_the_north_title: "Rivals in the North"
 rivals_in_the_north_desc: "From the north the Ainu have worked to dominate these fair isles. It is time that someone else worked to encourage prosperity amongst the people. It is for this reason that we are shaping up to become Ainu's rival. The only problem is that in our current state we are far too weak to claim such a position. By expanding we should be able to counter Ainu's domination of the isles."
 expanding_the_sphere_title: "Pushing Towards Sendai"
 expanding_the_sphere_desc: "The easiest way to display why we ought to seek domination over the lands of the Sendai comes from an excerpt from a description of the lands by a man of Antebellum during the height of the Tohoku kingdom. “And in the city of Senai on the streets and in the hearts of her people one thing rings true, honor. Unlike the scoundrels of the Ohio steppe or the money hungry traders of the lakes these people know an honor in their fellow man”."
 the_nakatsugwans_title: "The Nakatsugwans"
 the_nakatsugwans_desc: "The Nakatsugwans broke from the shogun nearly 400 years ago during the Nakasendo wars and have tried to maintain autonomy ever since. Originally their break was a disastrous thing for the old Shogun, for the city of Nagoya was still under their control. However it has since been a boon as endless wars plague southern Honshu. Now that we own a much more centralized state it would be much easier to reclaim these former lands of ours."
 taking_back_our_city_title: "Taking back Nagoya"
 taking_back_our_city_desc: "The city of Nagoya split roughly 200 years ago during the last period of great collapse for the shogun. The shogun lost the cities of Nagoya and Tsu during this time which precipitated a fading into obscurity. These two cities were left without protection at which point the small duchy of Wakayama conquered the formerly shogun lands and united the Kii peninsula. Now it is our time to reclaim the rest of our former lands and make up for the mistakes of our ancestors."
 great_nippon_title: "Great Nippon"
 great_nippon_desc: "From the city of Sendai to the great ports of Nagoya we have done our part to mostly unite Nippon. There still lies some land outside of our reach but these essential cities give us more than enough legitimacy to reclaim the ancient Reiwan title. With this new title we should look forward to further expansion."
 enlist_northern_push_title: "Enlist Northern Push"
 enlist_northern_push_desc: "If we are to go forward with the conquest of these fair isles we ought to take it one side at a time to avoid being closed in on. Our historic rivals in the north, the Ainu, could prove a quick early target. We simply need to kick them out of Tohoku and chase them into Hokkaido. From there we would have access to the gulf which they so foolishly lost to the maple throne."
 tohoku_domination_title: "Tohoku Domination"
 tohoku_domination_desc: "The eastern half of Tohoku ought to be our first stop. Now that we have claimed the city of Sendai we have a forward capital to plan our new invasions. The lands of Iwate, Miyagi, and Yamagata have historically been within the sphere of the Ainu but recently have become more detached with the massive Ainu loss at the hands of the Canadians. We will slither into the area which they have neglected to regain."
 freeing_the_niigatans_title: "Freeing the Niigatans"
 freeing_the_niigatans_desc: "On the other half of Tohoku lies Sendai’s sister city of Niigata. Historically it is said that the city was the birthplace of life on the isles. The island of gold in its north is one of the major ways that the Ainu continue to survive after losing their northern trade. If we were to take these lands we would cut off their ties from Honshu and push them completely onto Hokkaido."
 into_hokkaido_title: "Into Hokkaido"
 into_hokkaido_desc: "The island of Hokkaido in our north will be the final stop on our journey. From humble origins we have come to usurp this grand kingdom’s role on the isles and we can only hope to do better than they have. The wind is filled with frost on the ports of Aomori, and it is now our job to sail forth and claim that isle beyond the strait."
 enlist_southern_push_title: "Enlist Southern Push"
 enlist_southern_push_desc: "If we are to go forward with the conquest of these fair isles we ought to take it one side at a time to avoid being closed in on. The first avenue of expansion ought to be south into Shikoku and Kyushu. These isles are shattered amongst various kingdoms and would be much easier than the united Ainu threat in the north. From there we could engage in more trade with Antebella and even push for taking Florida."
 southern_honshu_title: "Southern Honshu"
 southern_honshu_desc: "Southern Honshu has historically been shattered amongst various states with little unity. Now the area is less divided but still ready to be sliced up. We must first rush the heartland cities of Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe. These lands will provide the basis for our operations in the south. It is also prudent for us to take the city of Himeji and its lucrative ports to store our ships for invasion of the isles of Kyushu and Shikoku."
 land_of_the_kami_title: "Land of the Kami"
 land_of_the_kami_desc: "We would be foolish to recognize the importance of taking the rest of Honshu for its religious significance. The holiest site of Itsukushima, the birthplace of Tenjin, lies just south of Hiroshima. The holy isle of Awaji was the site on which the great Leyasu of the Matsuyama shogunate was murdered by his brother Ryushi of the Reiwans. These lands hold with them strategic utility, but also legitimacy in the eyes of the Kami."
 the_noble_isle_title: "The Noble Isle"
 the_noble_isle_desc: "The island of Kyushu was a once great empire before its own internal struggles. The people of the island are fiercely independent and would harshly resist any attempt at conquest. However the land is rich with their signature tea and impressive porcelain goods. Our ships now creak with anticipation to reclaim this last nugget of the south and fully unite Japan once and for all."
 a_dynasty_to_rival_reiwan_title: "A New Reiwan"
 a_dynasty_to_rival_reiwan_desc: "The majority of the Japanese isles now lie under our reign. From our small city we have come to dominate the entirety of our known world. The new question comes, what is next? Shall we do what the Kyushans could not and tame Florida? Will we go north and take the gulf back from the Canadians? Or shall we forge our own path in New Canaan, Antebella, or the Caribbean? The future gleams bright for the empire of the east."
 reform_the_shogun_court_title: "Reform the Shogun Court"
 reform_the_shogun_court_desc: "Our nation is in a very precarious situation. The rest of the southern cities are ready to revolt, our coffers are running dry, and our former allies are readying themselves for invasion. In times such as these it is prudent to restore the old council of the shogun. This court was originally composed by representatives of every city and was nearly thousands of members large. Now it would pale to its former state, but could still provide utility for our collapsing state."
 revoke_trading_rights_title: "Revoke Trading Rights"
 revoke_trading_rights_desc: "A proposal from the crowd of the court has stated that we ought to revoke trading rights from the daimyos. This will be met with mild anger, but with their own representation they will have to acknowledge that it was by their own hand. Convincing a couple of diplomats will require immense pressure, but once done we should be able to be one step forward to solving our financial insolvency."
 blessed_waters: "Blessed Waters"
 north_sea_ambitions: "North Sea Ambitions"
 claim_a_new_throne_title: "Claim a New Throne"
 claim_a_new_throne_desc: "The time has come, we have maintained friendly relations with our subjects for long enough that they will now accept full rule. The delegation proposed a total reconstruction of the shogun form of government. Now there will be one high king of the Southern Cities, and a council of nobles below him that would represent the former respective cities that once were fully independent. We shall claim this new heritage and forge a path anew throughout Nippon."
