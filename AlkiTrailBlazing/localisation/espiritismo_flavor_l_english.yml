 espiritismo_events.1.t: "A Faith of Many Parts"
 espiritismo_events.1.d: "Espiritismo can be thought of as less of a single unified religion, like those of America or Mexico, but rather a collection of associated beliefs. The faith is split into a collection of different denominations, referred to as “cults” by the uneducated. Each of these denominations represents a wholly unique set of beliefs and practices which share some similarity with other Espiritismo sects. Despite this, most of the world outside of the Mexican-American axis was defined as being of a singular, Spiritist belief. We have just begun our journey into the faith. The denominations we embrace at this point will come to define our nation’s practice into future generations. May we come to appreciate each point of view and define ourselves in the light."

 espiritismo_events.2.t: "Spirits of Cuba"
 espiritismo_events.2.d: "Before its conversion at the hands of the papists, Cuba was the thriving heart of Espiritismo civilization. The centuries of island development resulted in the foundation of three, distinctly Cuban, denominations. Among these are Santería, Palo, and Abakuá. Santería was the most widely practiced denomination, centering around the worship of deities known as Orisha. In smaller numbers, the Palo practiced their worship through giving offerings to the Nganga, a vessel believed to house a spirit. The Abakuá represented the most secretive denomination, practiced among the members of their shadowy society. Their club was only open to the most affluent and influential among the Cuban population. Through mingling with the Cubanos, we have become accustomed to these denominations. In the future, we may even embrace them in earnest."
 espiritismo_events.2.a: "Interesting."
 espiritismo_events.3.t: "Of Orisha and Lwa"
 espiritismo_events.3.d: "Through contact with the Hispaniolans, we have come to appreciate their own unique Espiritismo practices and beliefs. Among the most prominent of their creed are the followers of Vodou. Originating from Haiti, Vodou espouses the existence of a pantheon of deities known as Lwa. Through rituals and worship, these Lwa can be instructed to protect believers and aid them in their goals. Similarly, the 21 Divisiones denomination worships a set of saints who are closely aligned with the Lwa. Both of these forms of Vodou are similar in belief, but often differ in the exact practice of rituals. The Orishan denomination originated from Afro-Cuban migrants to Hispaniola who melded their Santería with the local Vodou faith. These three denominations form the backbone of Hispaniolan spirituality. With our new appreciation for their belief, we have become accustomed to these denominations. In the future, we may even embrace them in earnest."
 espiritismo_events.3.a: "Interesting."
 espiritismo_events.4.t: "Island Practice"
 espiritismo_events.4.d: "Among the many islands of the Caribbean sea, there are an uncountable number of different denominations. However, through our interactions with those of the Antillean creed, we have come to appreciate some of the most popular of their traditions. The Rastafari deviate heavily from traditional Espiritismo practice, believing in a single divine creator known as Jah. Through intermingling with Catholic traditions, some in the Caribbean have come to embrace a new denomination they call Hijos de Dios. In this practice, believers worship a cult of different saints who bless followers through worship. On the island of Puerto Rico, the Cemí denomination preserves the ancient rites and practices of the Taino people. Through mingling with the Antilleans, we have become accustomed to these denominations. In the future, we may even embrace them in earnest."
 espiritismo_events.4.a: "Interesting."
 espiritismo_events.5.t: "That Dark Jungle"
 espiritismo_events.5.d: "To the uneducated onlooker or haughty papist, the jungles of Amazona may look to be filled with primitive animists, but those that take a closer look will find a diverse range of religious beliefs and expression among the different groups. In the lands of Suriname, one can find followers of the Winti denomination celebrating and giving praise to the spirits of the same name. Among the caraquenos, you will find a universal love for María Lionza. Every year, thousands of followers make a pilgrimage to the mountain where her spirit is said to reside. One may even hear the deep thuds of drums throughout the jungle as those that follow Tambor de Mina play songs to appease Voduns. Through mingling with the Amazonians, we have become accustomed to these denominations. In the future, we may even embrace them in earnest."
 espiritismo_events.5.a: "Interesting."
 espiritismo_events.6.t: "Imperial Espiritismo"
 espiritismo_events.6.d: "The beating heart of the Espiritismo world lies in Malaysia and Patagonia. Within the borders of the Great Brazilian empire, thousands follow the denominations of Candomblé and Umbanda. Centered around a pantheon of deities known as the Orixás, both of these denominations blend together their beliefs and practices, yet remain separate in some of their central doctrines. The Candomblé encourage possession by the Orixás through worship and elaborate celebration. The Umbanda seek to live under the protection of the spirits of the natural world. Together, the two faiths form the backbone of Brazilian spirituality. A third denomination, Anitism, holds the majority of practitioners outside of the empire. Hailing from the Philippines, the Anitism denomination centers around the mediation of spirits known as Anito. Our adoption of these diverse cultures have led us to become accustomed with their denominations.  In the future, we may even embrace them in earnest."
 espiritismo_events.6.a: "Interesting."
 espiritismo_events.7.t: "New World Gods"
 espiritismo_events.7.d: "Among the men of the frontier, across the sea in the new world, new Espiritismo denominations have arisen that blend together the faith of the natives with our old traditions. Among the two most prominent of these new denominations are Yorubite and Zhongish vodou. Yorubite Vodou places a special focus on the actions of a shaman. The shaman is said to guide worship and assist followers in personal religious troubles. Zhongish Vodou centers around the maintenance of asé, a fundamental force believed to exist throughout all things. Through rituals and celebration, it is believed that one can balance asé and bring peace to the world. Our efforts to explore and colonize the new world have brought us into contact with these new denominations. In the future, we may even embrace them in earnest."
 espiritismo_events.7.a: "Interesting."
 espiritismo_events.8.t: "Iward Branches"
 espiritismo_events.8.d: "To the west of Amazona, our Espiritismo brothers practice their faith in scattered denominations. Under the papal thumb, their beliefs have been suppressed. Yet, many still continue to persist. We have come to learn about their forms of worship and gain an appreciation for them. The Yanis worship a pantheon of spirits known as orixtals that correspond to the heavenly bodies. Those that follow the Yuyu denomination believe in the existence of magic, which they can harness through sacrifice and initiation to impact the natural world. Our acceptance of Colombian and Andean peoples has given us unique insight into these denominations. In the future, we may even embrace them in earnest."
 espiritismo_events.8.a: "Interesting."
 espiritismo_events.9.t: "Things We Haven't Even Tried"
 espiritismo_events.9.d: "Far from the home of Espiritismo, among the heathens of America, there are some who still practice the old ways. The Hoodoo denomination thrives in small communities that practice one of the oldest forms of the Espiritismo faith. Using the Bible as a guide for their practice, followers of Hoodoo attempt to alter the natural world through offerings and worship. Whether for money, health, or power, root doctors are constantly manipulating the supernatural world to get what they want. Through our conquest of the Sacramental folk, we have discovered some of the remaining practitioners of Hoodoo and learned of their unique denomination. In the future, we may even embrace the practice ourselves."
 espiritismo_events.9.a: "Interesting."
 espiritismo_events.10.t: "The Eastern Cults"
 espiritismo_events.10.d: "The isles of the east are not unfamiliar to Espiritismo practice. Centuries of trade between the Caribbean isles and the men of the east has melded their faiths, creating a unique denomination as a byproduct. Shinteria serves as a medium between the Santería faith and Reiwa Shinto. Its belief centers around the worship of Okamisha, hybridized versions of the Orisha and Kami. Followers of Shinteria worship these deities in order to gain their unique blessings. To conduct rituals or even contact the Okamisha, one must be ritually pure. Typically this is accomplished through either a spiritual or literal baptism. Through our conquest of the Shinto folk, we have rediscovered this old denomination and gained unique insight into its followers. In the future, we may even embrace the practice ourselves."
 espiritismo_events.10.a: "Interesting."
 espiritismo_events.11.t: "Our Lady"
 espiritismo_events.11.d: "Among the Catholics of Mexico, there is a belief that cannot just be snuffed out. For centuries, Tepeyac has attempted to suppress the heresy of Santa Muerte, but has never seen any success. Veneration of the spirit has entrenched itself deeply into Mexican society. In a time before the papacy spread its infernal tendrils across that continent, many practiced a denomination dedicated to Santa Muerte. They gave offerings to Our Lady of Death and celebrated her gentle influence. Through our conquest of Catholic lands, we have rediscovered this buried secret and come to understand the ancient denomination which followed her. In the future, we may even embrace the practice ourselves."
 espiritismo_events.11.a: "Interesting."
 espiritismo_events.12.t: "Toque de Santo"
 espiritismo_events.12.d: "Santeros and santeras, it is time for us to celebrate and give thanks to the spirits which have protected us throughout the years. Of all Santería celebrations, none are more important than Toque de Santo. Through playing specialized drums known as batá, we may summon one of the Orisha to take control of our monarch. We have gathered the offerings and assembled the worshipers. The only question that remains is which Orisha we shall call to mount our monarch? Should it be the fiery Chango, the sublime Yemayá, or even the lost Ochún? Of course, Eleguá will always be nearby when initiating the ritual and Oyá can always be relied upon to be ever present in our lives. Whatever our choice, let us enjoy this great honor and cherish the wisdom of these powerful Orisha."

 espiritismo_events.13.d: "Every Santerían community must have a place for the faithful to gather and conduct rituals. In the houses of santeros and santeras, one room is slated to be Igbodu. In the Igbodu, the most generous offerings are placed and the most important rituals are conducted. As the ruler of a powerful nation, the Igbodu in our own capital is expected to be grand and luxurious. Yet, as of late, our royal Igbodu has fallen into a state of disrepair. An excess of rituals and footraffice has worn down its once gracious form. Repairing the sacred room would cost our administration greatly, but the rewards would be immense."

 espiritismo_events.14.d: "Sacrifice is a necessary part of life. We split our time and sacrifice our bodies to accomplish work. We sacrifice the fruits of our labor in order to better the lives of those around us. Despite this, there are some lines involving sacrifice which many are hesitant to cross. In [Root.Capital.GetName], dug into the ground, there is a large metal vessel filled with sticks and bones of the fallen. This great Nganga serves as the home to many spirits, each of which blesses our nation and provides us with protection. These spirits hunger, hunger for offerings and sacrifice. The larger the sacrifice, the greater their reward. For the sake of our nation, for the betterment of our people, perhaps a great sacrifice must be made to satiate their hunger."

 espiritismo_events.15.t: "Nganga"
 espiritismo_events.15.d: "Central to Palo worship is the Nganga, a vessel which is filled with sticks and believed to hold spirits. Offerings are given to the vessel in order to satiate the spirit within and impact the natural world. Whether these impacts are positive or negative depends on the Nganga itself. Ngangas which are meant for good are baptized, while those that are used to harm are left uncleaned. As the leader of a pious Palo nation, we have access to our own personal Ngangas which we may use as we please. One of them has grown to the proper size for baptism, it is now time to decide whether we should purify it or leave it unclean."

 espiritismo_events.16.d: "Our prominent status as the leader of an Espiritismo nation has brought unwanted attention to the Abakuá society. While we have managed to keep our practices secret from the public thus far, the prying eyes of certain nosy bureaucrats may soon change this. In order to better suppress the secretive aspects of Abakuá, some of our closest advisors have suggested that we embark on a campaign of disinformation. Through covertly influencing the nobles of [Root.GetAdjective] society, we can draw attention away from our own actions to other issues. Of course, such an undertaking would undermine our responsibility as a proper ruler. Perhaps it would be for the best for our citizens if we came clean about our membership now, lest they discover it on their own in the future."

We all share a single bond connected through this society, which we can use to manipulate the classes below us. Out of the many opportunities for manipulation, three jump out as the most impactful. First, we could make the lower rungs of society more docile and open to our judgments. Even better, we could use our influence to embolden the military and encourage them to fight more fiercely. Perhaps we could even tap into the wealthy banks of merchants and siphon off a little of their hoarded wealth for our administration. When you're at the top, the options are limitless."

 espiritismo_events.18.d: "Vodou, Vodoun, or even sometimes Voodoo, is a nebulous label. Often, it is given to Espiritismo denominations which are said to closely align with the original Encantarian Vodun practiced in a time before the fall of man. Our tradition, 21 Divisiones, has been in constant contact with Haitian Vodou throughout the history of our faith. Our pantheon of deities, known as Lwa, share many of the same names and attributes. Our rituals and their preparation follow the same structure. Taking all of these similarities in account, perhaps it is time for us to more closely align ourselves with the Haitian variety and embrace our neighbors under one Vodou."

These deities represent fundamental aspects of the natural world, which can be manipulated by those who earn their interest. The most common way to gain favor with a particular Lwa is to give offerings. Often, these offerings are associated with earthly pleasures like food and drink. As a growing Espiritismo state, our nation is filled with citizens who are desperate for the opportunity to give. Demand for certain goods has sharley risen alongside our growth. The ultimate impact of this development has been a large boost in the production of coffee, sugar, and tobacco products. It seems that the Lwa have yet again helped us to achieve our aims, however indirectly."

Whether they be possessed with spirits, connected to other worlds, or simply blessed, sacred objects help to connect Vodouists to the supernatural. As the ruler of a pious Vodou nation, it is important that we have both a mastery of these mystical traditions. A routine ritual at the capital quickly evolved into a much more involved affair as our oungan perceived the presence of a powerful spirit.

 espiritismo_events.21.d: "Like most Espiritismo denominations, the practice of Vodou varies widely between urban and rural communities. Many states have tried to formalize the practice of Vodou, yet few have succeeded completely. Most end up achieving a sense of “Nation Vodou”, where a singular branch of the faith is primarily practiced in all major cities, but mostly ignored in the countryside. Recently, some in our nation have begun to stray from our designated practice of Vodou. If left to fester, their rebellious streak could spread to others and cause the collapse of our religious authority. If it is possible, we must take decisive action to preserve the national practice of the faith. We must be united under our belief. If not, we may fall victim to the malevolent spirits."
 espiritismo_events.21.a: "At all costs."
 espiritismo_events.21.b: "Let them worship how they wish."
 espiritismo_events.22.t: "Ase"
 espiritismo_events.22.d: "While not unique to Orishan Vodoun, Ase plays a fundamental role in the lives of its practitioners. The substance is thought to be everpervasive, a fundamental force that flows throughout all things and causes all changes. As Orishans, we believe that we can come to learn how to manipulate the Ase through initiation and heavy practice. Ase can give insight into the future, help to change the course of events, and even heal the sick. As the ruler of a pious Orishan nation, we have come to appreciate the usefulness of Ase in assisting us in our rule. Under the guidance of trained mediators, we can manipulate Ase to help stabilize and even heal entire peoples. Let the Orisha guide us and the Ase flow through us, for protection, for peace, for good."
 espiritismo_events.22.a: "All will change."
 espiritismo_events.23.t: "Olodumare Worship"
 espiritismo_events.23.d: "Among the countless number of different deities within the Orishan pantheon, only one has the title of ultimate creator: Olodumare. Despite this prolific status, the worship of Olodumare is considered taboo due its relationship with the Orisha. It is believed that Olodumare contains many aspects, which exist in all things and places. Therefore, worship to Olodumare is to worship all aspects of creation including the bad. Despite all of this, there are some in our nation who have begun to worship the creator spirit. This heresy cannot stand within our pious nation, something must be done to correct their practice and reenvelop them back into the proper traditions."

 espiritismo_events.24.t: "Nyabinghi Issemblie"
 espiritismo_events.24.d: "Of all celebrations in the Rastafari denomination, none are as grand and enlightening as the Nyabinghi Issemlies. These “groundings” occur on Rastafari holidays and often draw the attention of hundreds of pious observers. Gathering in open fields and Tabernacles, Rastas will celebrate, smoke, and reflect. For months, some of our citizens in [Root.Capital.GetName] have planned to throw one of the largest Issemlies in the history of the faith. Followers from around the country have come to gather in the capital in order to celebrate alongside their fellow Rastas. We have been personally invited to the Issemlie, how shall we make use of our time there?"
 espiritismo_events.24.a: "Give a speech."

 espiritismo_events.24.c: "Enjoy the celebration."
 espiritismo_events.25.t: "The Holy Herb"
 espiritismo_events.25.d: "Perhaps the most famous aspect of our denomination’s worship is our consumption of The Holy Herb: Ganja. Despite this, there are many misconceptions about its use among the most faithful of our followers. It is not habitually consumed, reserved for special occasions and times of deep reflection. Most only use the herb during their introduction to the faith, believing themselves to have reached a oneness with Livity afterwards. Of course, ganja is still incredibly important for many practitioners of the faith. A consequence of this has been the increased production of the herb alongside other crops. Our tobacco producing farms have mostly shifted over their growth to ganja instead of their normal crop. May this fill our hearts and coffers with green!"

 espiritismo_events.26.d: "Our nation is now accosted by a horrible curse of pagan spirits. Among our followers, some of the most faithful are beginning to worship spirits known as “Orishta.” No doubt a holdover from their earlier witchcraft, these spirits could lead some in our nation to embrace the devil! We must do something to stop their worship and ensure that the saints get their due. To permanently snuff out this heatheny, we must target their shrines and idols. It is likely that they will resist any attempt to destroy these dear relics, but that will be an easy price to pay for their future salvation. May the saints forgive them, for they know not what they do."

 espiritismo_events.26.b: "They will return in time."
 espiritismo_events.27.t: "Saint Blessings"
 espiritismo_events.27.d: "While the Vodou have their Lwa and the Santería have their Orisha, we have deviated from such barbaric practices and embraced the worship of Saints. These pious individuals once helped to deliver man from sorrow and now will bring back his salvation. As the ruler of a Hijos de Dios state, we are expected to dedicate our rule to one of these holy individuals. Out of the many options we have limited our choices down to seven of the most compatible saints. We must choose between the merciful Saint Anne, the noble Saint Michael, the valorous Saint Charles, the charming Saint Martha, the strong Saint James, the pious Saint Elijah, and the sorrowful Mater Dolours. Whatever choice we make, let it serve the interests of our people and the heavens above."

 espiritismo_events.28.t: "Cohoba"
 espiritismo_events.28.d: "Just beyond the shroud of the natural world, there lies a realm of spirits and the mystical. In order to tap into this place, one must undergo a ritual led by a shaman. The Cemí, known as ancestor spirits to the faithful, can be contacted through such rituals. With their help, one can heal the sick, find great fortunes, or even see into the future. Contact with the Cemí is a difficult process, but comes naturally to some. For [Root.Monarch.GetName] this is not the case. For months, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has attempted ritual after ritual to no avail. However, a wise man of the countryside has recently ventured to our capital and offered help in this matter. With the assistance of a substance known as Cohoba, supposedly [Root.Monarch.GetName] will have easy access to the Cemí. While this man is strange, he does seem to know much about the spirits. Perhaps we should indulge him and embark on the journey."
 espiritismo_events.28.a: "We journey onwards."
 espiritismo_events.28.b: "Too dangerous."
 espiritismo_events.29.t: "Blessings of Boinayel"
 espiritismo_events.29.d: "Of the Cemí pantheon, few are more prominent in the lives of the everyday follower than Boinayel. Son of Iguanaboína. Boinayel serves as the spiritual manifestation of rain. Through the blessings of this Cemí, crops are saturated and droughts are ended. Some among us believe that they can appease Boinayel through worship and bring the rains. Whatever the case, we have been blessed with bountiful rains and even more wonderful harvests. In the province of [place_where_boinayel_will_gift.GetName] the pristine conditions of this recent season have brought with them an unexpected surplus. If left to stay in the province, this harvest will likely attract people from throughout our nation and boost the local population. Some of our closest advisors have suggested diverting this surplus grain to our own capital to bolster its population rather than some wayward village."
 espiritismo_events.29.a: "[place_where_boinayel_will_gift.GetName] will benefit greatly."
 espiritismo_events.29.b: "[Root.Capital.GetName] needs the growth."
 espiritismo_events.30.t: "Soul of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 espiritismo_events.30.d: "Among the Winti, many believe that the soul is split into three different aspects. The Dyodyo are the supernatural spirits, referred to as Winti, which watch over and guide the soul throughout life. The Kra is the pure soul, the vessel which is inhabited by the Dyodyo. The final part, the Yorka, serves as the learning part of the soul. Throughout the life of the individual, the Yorka receives and learns from experience. Many Winti scholars have pointed out that this concept is not simply restricted to the souls of men, but to other creatures and concepts. The souls of animals, communities, and even entire nations can be explained through this three pronged structure. We must decide how we wish to rule over our people. Shall we be the everguiding influence like the Dyodyo? The pure vessel for the will of the people like the Kra? Or even a wise guide like Yorka?"

 espiritismo_events.31.d: "Fears from the province of [place_where_there_might_be_apuku.GetName] have started to disrupt local life. Within the Winti world, there are spirits who are said to be able to possess the bodies of believers known as Apuku. These Apuku are feared among Winti society for their ability to seamlessly blend into communities and cause mischief. Some in the town of [fears_of_apuku_esp.GetName] have grown paranoid of their own neighbors for this very reason. They believe that a group of Apuku have infiltrated their community and are now attempting to sabotage their livelihood. Some in our administration have suggested that we send out our court missionary to deal with the matter, but that would prevent him from doing his valuable work of converting heretics."

 espiritismo_events.32.t: "Blessing of María"
 espiritismo_events.32.d: "Wonderful news has reached [Root.Capital.GetName] from the front. Right at the crown of dawn, many of our own soldiers were greeted by an apparition of María Lionza among the clouds. Such appearances are not uncommon amongst the faithful of our denomination, with María appearing to those in need during times of great crisis. As we now fight a battle for our faith, it is always a welcome sight to see that the spirits are on our side. With this great gift, the men and women of the front will surely fight with an unforeseen ferocity. Let us give thanks to María for this great gift and ready ourselves for victory!"
 espiritismo_events.32.a: "Inspire the soldiers!"
 espiritismo_events.32.b: "Keep them in line!"
 espiritismo_events.32.c: "Bring out the horses!"
 espiritismo_events.33.t: "Recieving Spirits"
 espiritismo_events.33.d: "For the outside observer, some may come to the conclusion that the Lioncero denomination is focused solely around the veneration of María Lionza. This could not be further from the truth. Spirits from throughout the history of Guyana and Amazona are worshiped right alongside María. Often, these spirits will even be welcomed to possess followers of the faith through elaborate ceremonies. The spirits are often picky, choosing only the most gifted individuals to puppet. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been granted this great honor, serving as the object of possession for a wise spirit. May they come to appreciate [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] status and serve our nation correctly."
 espiritismo_events.33.a: "Excellent"
 espiritismo_events.34.t: "Rhythm of the State"
 espiritismo_events.34.d: "Rhythm plays a fundamental role for those of the Tambor de Mina denomination. The Vodun, deities who can impact the natural world, are able to be attracted and appeased using different rhythms. Even the name of the denomination relates to the importance of musical celebration and rhythm. Just as music has rhythm, everyday life has its own sort of rhythm. Farmers till the earth with a repetition, the sun rises and sets in the same way, and the wind blows by with a musical charm. In [Root.Capital.GetName] we can feel this rhythm among the people. Let us take a moment to listen, what do you hear?"

 espiritismo_events.34.c: "Rhythm of the Generals"
 espiritismo_events.35.t: "Pool of Belief"
 espiritismo_events.35.d: "Our faith draws upon many different fundamental roots. The Vodun, that wise group of spirits, originates from the old pantheons of Encantaria. The saints which bless the Vodun and ward off evil originate from the traditions of Catholics. Even the very rituals we conduct, involving their mess of drums and sublime music, hold their roots in the old practices of Amazona natives. All of these different influences often make it difficult for our nation to maintain a national standard of belief. Some in our administration have suggested that we focus on a particular aspect of belief to formalize before we attempt to stabilize others."

 espiritismo_events.36.t: "A Priestly [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 espiritismo_events.36.d: "Initiation into the Candomblé priesthood is not an easy task. One must dedicate their lives to the worship of the orixás and allow themselves to be possessed by them constantly. Losing control in such a manner is not befitting for a ruler who must make pivotal religious decisions, yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] has undergone the process to become closer to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] faith. With this new status as a priest [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be able to directly evangelize to the heretics and heathens of our nation. May the orixás protect our nation and bring justice to those who still struggle against their grasp!"
 espiritismo_events.36.a: "Wonderful!"
 espiritismo_events.37.t: "Underfunded Terreiros"
 espiritismo_events.37.d: "Terreiors are vital to the practice of Candomblé. Followers of the faith often gather within these spaces to worship the orixás and celebrate their gifts. While there are some overarching organizations that try to tie together the terrerios, most are independent and run by a single priest. This has led to a serious gap in quality of worship throughout our nation. Those in the countryside may not even have a terreio to gather and worship at. Many in our administration have begun clamoring for us to do something about this grave injustice. We must act quickly, lest our citizens be robbed of the ability to practice their own faith."
 espiritismo_events.37.a: "We will fund them ourselves."

 espiritismo_events.38.t: "Branch Conflict"
 espiritismo_events.38.d: "Umbanda is one of the largest Espiritismo denominations and as such is split in some of its practices. The various branches of the faith have come to cause headaches for any Umbanda ruler attempting to corral [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] populace. When the Brazilian empire decided to select Umbanda as their official denomination, the ensuing controversy between the branches almost tore the entire country apart. As the ruler of a mighty Espiritismo nation, it is our duty to ensure that the proper form of the faith is practiced among our citizens. We must choose which of these branches will characterize our rule."

 espiritismo_events.39.t: "Spiritual Support"
 espiritismo_events.39.d: "One of the fundamental aspects of Umbanda is the relationship between humans and orixá. For protection, favor, and health, followers of the faith will enter relationships with these deities. To do so, one must first give an offering in an attempt to appease the orixá. Each spirit has its own favorite offerings and takes into account the value of the gifts. Among believers, the most common offering to the orixá are spices due to their rare, but not unaffordable, nature. For our nation, this has meant a boost in the production of spices as demand is driven up by our growing number of followers. "

 espiritismo_events.40.d: "Anitism shares a different relationship with spirits compared to other Espiritismo denominations. For its followers, the spirits of the world are to be feared rather than worshiped. The shamans of the denomination are seen as necessary wardens against the terrorizing influence of these supernatural forces. Despite all of this, sometimes it becomes necessary to draw upon these spirits to bring about change in the natural world. For this task, believers will often conduct elaborate rituals known as Pag-Anitos. Our nation is in need of spiritual meditation, yet there are few among our court who are knowledgeable in aspects of the mystical world. We must decide who we wish to send on this difficult task. "

 espiritismo_events.41.t: "Dambana"
 espiritismo_events.41.d: "Anitists rarely practice their worship in physical temples, instead preferring to linger in sacred sites throughout the land. When attempting to commune with the spirits, shamans will often construct temporary shelters at these sites known as Dambanas for the spirits to temporarily inhabit. Over time, these Dambanas have grown to become sacred sites in themselves that are untouchable by the faithful. In the province of [place_where_dambana_is_gonna_be.GetName], an ancient Dambana has recently been unearthed by the locals. If left to stay, much of the land surrounding the shrine would be abandoned and become unusable by the populace. We are left with the difficult decision of ruling on whether or not the spirit within the Dambana should be respected or cast away."

Among the natives of this region we have found commonality in our denomination and their faith. The Shamanists of this new world practice a faith similar, but slightly different from our own. Through contact with them we have come to mutually respect our beliefs and even sit side by side during worship. In the province of [place_where_dambana_is_gonna_be.GetName], some of these natives have even joined up with our local village and decided to embrace our faith in earnest. Together, as brothers and sisters, we will face the challenges of this world through the guidance of our ancestors."

 espiritismo_events.43.d: "Among the spirits, there are none more powerful than the Orija. The Orija represent fundamental aspects of the natural world like fire or love. Under their influence, these forces are maintained and controlled in a harmonious balance. It is this balance which practitioners of Zhongish Vodou attempt to maintain. Through careful worship and negotiations with the Orija, our nation has finally obtained a temporary harmony.

The brilliant sun, which gave us life so long ago, moves us to work, to earn, to live. Her sister, the Moon, lets us finally rest once we are old and weary. Together they balance the world.

As a Yuyu nation, we aim to use the gifts of magic in order to benefit our rule and ensure prosperity among our people.

Guided by a root doctor, Seeking entails celebration, singing, and the ring shout. Circling around the participant, worshipers will clap and stomp their feet for hours at a time. By the end of the process, the participant is said to have been possessed by the holy spirit and saved.

Despite this, some of our citizens have still found time to remember and enjoy the legacy of the fallen. Under Santa Muerte’s guidance, believers from throughout the nation have left their homes and begun to celebrate.

As [Root.Monarch.GetName] grows in age, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] faces progressively more difficult challenges.

Most followers of Espiritismo do not concern themselves with the exact nature of cosmology or the identities of spirits. Such things are seen as unimportant, intangible, and unknowable. The only thing that matters to followers is the practice of rituals. If not performed correctly, rituals may be nullified or even bring bad spirits to inhabit sacred places. While conducting a routine public ritual in [Root.Capital.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetName] made a minor mistake in the incantations which jeopardized many in the crowd. News of this incident has spread across the countryside, causing many of our citizens to question [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s judgment."
 espiritismo_events.54.a: "Horror!"
 espiritismo_events.55.t: "Wordly Spirits"
 espiritismo_events.55.d: "Sometimes the spirits act in mysterious ways. Their motives are unknowable to most, only a handful of lifelong shamans have ever gotten close to understanding their mystical ways. Coupled with the evershifting conflicts between these spirits, it's surprising that followers of the faith are even able to contact them at all. Our nation has recently experienced a streak of good luck, which we believe to be related to the spirits. Across the countryside, farmers report the most bountiful harvests they have ever achieved. In dark mines, our workmen find rare metals and deeply colored gems. On the high seas, our traders find unbelievable deals. Whatever game the spirits are playing, it's going in our favor. Let us enjoy this while it lasts and prepare for the worst."

 espiritismo_events.55.b: "Invest in the Temples." 
 espiritismo_events.56.t: "Classical Music"
 espiritismo_events.56.d: "Music serves an important role in many of our rituals. The thudding of drums, flare of pipes, and twang of strings can be heard throughout all Espiritismo cities. Such beautiful sounds have begun to be replaced by the horrendous screeches of the so-called “Classical Music.” Classicalism emerged from California and brought with it a plague of American culture. Some of the most pious among our citizenry have called upon our administration to ban the playing of this music. While they are not explicitly doing anything wrong, we may be forced to go through with the ban for the sake of our ears."

 espiritismo_events.57.t: "Codifying Our Faith"
 espiritismo_events.57.d: "Espiritismo is a diverse faith, composed of hundreds of different denominations. Yet, there are some aspects of the faith which most can agree upon and recognize to be true. The presence of spirits, the importance of rituals, and the role of ancestors are all common among different denominations. Some in our administration have suggested that we codify these aspects of our faith and enforce their practice among all members of our populace. With an exact definition in the books, we can work towards making our nation much more congruent. However, if a large portion of our population comes to disagree with what we have decided to be the proper practice, we could face heavy backlash. We must carefully consider the consequences of such a decision before we go forward with its implantation."
 espiritismo_events.57.a: "Everyone must follow the proper practice!"
 espiritismo_events.57.b: "Let them practice as they please."
 espiritismo_events.58.t: "Interpretation Scuffle"
 espiritismo_events.58.d: "Our attempts to codify the Espiritismo faith have backfired. While we were off to a good start, divisions began to emerge among some of our most fervent citizens. They took issue with some of our definitions and began to denounce our whole administration for their ignorance. Of course, those that agreed with our codification began to disagree with the dissenters. This back and forth has spiked tensions in our country and made many normal citizens wary of our rule. We now must make the decisions of whether to back down and revoke our codification or double down and take out the dissenters. Such a decision would likely harm the stability of our nation."
 espiritismo_events.58.a: "Set them right."
 espiritismo_events.58.b: "Abandon the Codification."
 espiritismo_events.59.t: "Doctoring"
 espiritismo_events.59.d: "Health is one of our most valuable resources. Money cannot buy health, at least not directly. Same with power. This was the case until man discovered how to commune with the spirits. Specialized shamans known as “doctors” provide the gift of health to all those who are in need. As the ruler of a powerful Espiritismo nation, we are gifted with a citizenry full of talented doctors who can assist in our rule. From our position, we can direct these doctors to heal a specific aspect of our nation. We will ensure that they conduct their rituals for…"
 espiritismo_events.59.a: "Health for the army!"
 espiritismo_events.59.b: "Health for [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 espiritismo_events.59.c: "Health for the people!"
 espiritismo_events.60.t: "Encantaria"
 espiritismo_events.60.d: "Long ago, before the fall of man, we all lived in a beautiful homeland. A paradise beyond the waves. This is the story passed down throughout the ages. The story of Encantaria. Every earthly need was sustained by the land. Then the spirits got involved. Through a terrible scheme they came to conquer the lands of Encantaria and subjugate the holy folk. We were enslaved, exploited, and then torn from Encantaria by these evil spirits. Through the years of prosperity, we were made to suffer. When man fell, we were freed. Allowed to live anew. All forms of the Espiritismo faith hold their roots in this ancient land. Some among our citizenry believe that we have found it once again. In the newly discovered world, on the continent of Pablonia, some explorers describe a place that precisely matches Encantaria. Whether this is the truth or not, many in our nation have been inspired by its discovery."
