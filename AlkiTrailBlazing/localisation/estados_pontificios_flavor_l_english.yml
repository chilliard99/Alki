 otrep_events.1.d: "Our rise to power has undeniably ruffled a few feathers. This would normally not be a problem, we are strong enough to defeat any who would oppose us, but we have recently drawn the ire of the pope. There are some wars which no nation can win. A war with the papacy would only end in shame for our great state. To avoid this fate, many of our ministers have suggested that we attempt the diplomatic route. If we were to send a sincere delegation of diplomats to their state and come to an agreement over the fate of our region, there would be no need for war. Yet, we still fear that much could go wrong. Perhaps the papal negotiators are too good and get us to agree to a deal that limits our growth. Perhaps the talks turn sour and we are forced to decide between war or cowardice. This is a precarious situation. Our decision here could very well decide the fate of the Catholic faith. We must carefully consider our options before moving forward."

To preserve the peace in Anahuac between our two nations, they propose that we negotiate for control of the region. It's no secret that our nation has harbored negative feelings towards the Oaxacans. Their rise to power in the east disrupted the careful balance of power we worked to cultivate throughout the centuries. Ever since they defeated the Huastecs at Veracruz we have feared that they would march into our cities. With this in mind, we must be wary of their delegation. Such talks may lead to the annexation or subjugation of our state. Yet, we cannot shy away from the promise of peace. Such an action would be antithetical to the core of our faith.

To move forward, we would need to once again become the center of world scholarship. We must reach out to the heretics and understand their grievances. \nOn the other side were the traditionalists. They argued that the church had already strayed from its roots. The centuries of wealth had led us to grow soft and accept a mediocre practice. Every failure of the church can be linked back to a fundamental failure to keep strength. Florida was the fault of the bickering crusaders, Italy was the fault of the Roman papacy, and Texas was the fault of the lackadaisical vaqueros.  They claim that we must exude strength and bolster the clergy in order to revive our church.

 otrep_events.20.t: "Archival Opportunities"
 otrep_events.20.d: "The process of updating the papal archives was a difficult one. It started with gathering new sources. One by one, across the Catholic world, our scholars traveled to every town and requested some of their documents. Once they returned to Mexico City, the documents were transcribed and copied using the new printing press. Our scholars then returned the documents to their original towns. All while this was happening, other academics were transcribing the thousands of documents already stored in the archives and copying them using the printing press. After all was said and done, we had created the most comprehensive collection of human knowledge this world has ever seen. Many of the scholars who have worked on this project now suggest that we share these archives with the world. Mexico City would become the hub for this scholarship, converting its fields of flowers to large mills. We could supply the world with an untold amount of knowledge."

We must ensure that they are not given the opportunity to corrupt another soul. Every righteous man, woman, and child must raise arms to defeat the Sagradista threat. We will snuff out their burning hearts."

 otrep_events.22.d: "Through the careful work of cardinals and academics, the Luzian cities of promise have been returned to the Catholic church. Ever since the dawn of the faith, these cities have served as hubs for those that rejected the words of Tepeyac. They believed that through scholarship and investigation one could come to understand the nature of God and the ethereal. Rigorous debate and discussion seems to have proved many of them wrong, calming down tensions and allowing the Luzians to return to their Catholic roots."
 otrep_events.22.a: "He will pay."
 otrep_events.23.t: "Leonese Order"
 otrep_events.23.d: "Our conquest of Leon has placed us in control of the Leonese order. The order traces its roots back to the tithe of Jalisco, when an order of knights wounded in combat took up missionary work. They spread Catholicism into the former lands of the Monrovian horde and followed the crusaders into Empresia. As the church grew, they grew. It wasn’t until the conquests of Texas and Arizonia that their order began to take a malicious turn. When normal methods of conversion didn’t take hold, the Leonese reverted to torture and public execution. Stories of the order’s brutish actions spread across the globe. The worst of their atrocities took place in Cuba, where they slaughtered entire Espiritismo villages and even murdered one of the island’s five kings. With all this in mind, it becomes difficult for our papacy to allow this order to continue to function under our rule. Their barbarous actions abroad would surely taint our reputation, but there's no denying that they are effective. We must carefully consider the future of the order, balancing our interests against the potential harm they may bring."

In a new papal bull, His Eminence has dissolved the former nation of Estados Pontificios and declared the “Reino de Dios.” This so-called Kingdom of God has been a long time coming for the papacy. As they have expanded throughout the continent, His Eminence has gradually bolstered the church’s influence. This development will certainly spell interesting changes for the Catholic world."
 otrep_events.24.a: "Praise be."
 otrep_events.25.t: "Called to Tepeyac"
 otrep_events.25.d: "The Catholic papacy has reached out to our nation and requested that we join them in their faith. They would send over a group of loyal missionaries and clergymen to help convert our people. It certainly is an alluring offer. Through adopting the faith we would join a global community of powerful nations. These nations could offer us help in wars against our enemies or even give us support in our time of need. We would be foolish to not consider this offer, let us take a moment to weigh the pros and cons before responding."
 otrep_events.25.a: "Praise be."
 otrep_events.25.b: "We could never!"
 otrep_events.27.t: "Sins of the Father"
 otrep_events.27.d: "The story of Colombia is one full of mistakes and woe. The great empire which came to dominate the region was built on the backs of crusaders. Those holy men conquered Bogota and established their own ideal paradise. It was a heavenly place for a few years. Then it fell into the trap of Isthmo. The affluent nobles started demanding rights and the ability to participate in government. A minor revolt turned to a civil war. One at a time, nobles started declaring their independence. All the while, our church stood by and did nothing. It was our duty to support the empire, we see that now., yet our forefathers chose inaction. Ever since this time, we have drifted from the people of Colombia. Every bishop's recommendation is quickly approved by whatever pope is in power. Little attention is paid towards the strife in the region. If left to continue down this path, the people of Colombia will no doubt fall to heresy. We must change course, reform the bishops and invest in the churches, before it is too late."

 otrep_events.28.a: "Such a shame."
 otrep_events.29.t: "Guadalupe Inquisition"
 otrep_events.29.d: "Through careful effort, we have managed to assemble a large missionary force for our conversion efforts. Currently, they are working to ensure that our state is free from the influence of heretics and heathens. While this is a noble goal, some of our ministers have suggested that they would be better put to use abroad. Having an inquisition, like the ones present during the crusades, would greatly increase the presence of our church throughout the Catholic world. Not only would we inspire a purer faith, but we would cultivate a stronger one. Every pious soul across the land could breathe a sigh of relief knowing that the wicked were dealt with. We would also garner a greater reputation among the Catholics. If our goal is to revive the traditional church, this would be the way to do it."
