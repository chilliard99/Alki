 idolatrous_reform_1: "Enforce Warrior Code"
 idolatrous_reform_1_desc: "Passed down through the generations, the warrior class of our tribe carries with them a special code. Within its many rules, it lays out the practice of war and the requirements for engagement with the enemy. Without its gentle guidance, wars between tribes would be brutish campaigns of total destruction. We must stand by this code during any future conflict."
 idolatrous_reform_2: "Perfect Agriculture"
 idolatrous_reform_2_desc: "Our tribe has relied upon the land to feed our people. Some of the more clever among our nation have come to find out that there are more efficient ways of caring for the earth. If we leave a part of our fields empty during the year, the crops that grow on it next will bloom with an unexpected fervor. Every farmer across the land must follow this practice."
 idolatrous_reform_3: "Centralize Belief"
 idolatrous_reform_3_desc: "There are many idols which are worshiped in our temples. Thousands of deities receive little or no praise, simply being leftovers of our ancestors. Praise to these spirits distracts from the ones that need it most. We must rid our temples of these outdated idols and centralize belief around the deities that still live in the minds of our tribesmen."
 idolatrous_reform_4: "Explore the Wilds"
 idolatrous_reform_4_desc: "The wilds beyond the borders of our tribe are full of potential. In a time long ago, some of our ancestors lived among these wilds and built great villages. We see the ruins of these past lands and mourn their loss. It is time to restore the fallen villages to their former glory. Let every curious heart ready themselves for travel. It is time to explore the wilds."
 idolatrous_reform_5: "Rediscover Ancient Wisdom"
 idolatrous_reform_5_desc: "The wisdom of our ancestors holds within it many practical uses. So much has been lost over the years to disease and creatures of the land. We must gather the elders of our tribe and hear what advice they have to give. Perhaps one of their ancient memories will bring about prosperity for all families of our tribe."
 idolatrous_events.1.t: "Idolatrous Reforms"
 idolatrous_events.1.d: "The authority of our ruler has grown high enough to allow for reformation of the faith. Many before us have attempted to wrest the many factions of our tribe into change. Few have ever achieved success. As we look towards further reforming our tribe, let us remember the lessons of those who have come before us and their mistakes. The wisdom of our elders, the knowledge of the past, and our tenacity will guide us to a brighter future. For now, we must deal with the consequences of our reform."
 idolatrous_events.1.a: "Everything has a price."
 idolatrous_events.2.t: "The Pestilence"
 idolatrous_events.2.d: "A new tribe has arrived in our lands. Some of those that border us say that they have come from beyond the seas, yet we doubt their claims. This new tribe is after nothing but blood and riches. They have cursed our people with an evil plague. It has already torn apart many of our villages. It makes widows out of the most loyal of wives and orphans out of the largest of families. The worst part about all of this is our inability to respond. The work of our more pious citizens cannot prevent the spread of this curse, nor have the Gods given any recourse to those who have spread it. We can only wait and watch as it all falls down."
 idolatrous_events.2.a: "Horror!"
 idolatrous_events.3.t: "A Meager Offering"
 idolatrous_events.3.d: "The Gods are a fickle sort. In order to earn their favor, one must give each of them what they request. If one is given too much, the other Gods will believe that we do not favor them and give us nothing. One God alone is not good enough to sustain our tribe. We require the help of them all to reform the idols. Some of the wisest elders of our tribe have suggested that we employ every craftsman of the land to build offerings to the Gods. With their collective help, we should be able to fabricate an offering in no time. Such an action would boost our authority amongst the deities and get us one step closer to total reformation."
 idolatrous_events.3.a: "May the Gods favor us."
 idolatrous_events.3.b: "We will find our own way."
 idolatrous_events.4.t: "Cries of the Intolerant"
 idolatrous_events.4.d: "While most members of our society are tolerant to the Gods of other men, some believe that the very existence of idols other than their own points to an evil. They believe that this evil has corrupted the very wisdom of our ancestors and threatens to destroy their own Gods. These intolerant sorts are mostly ignored, but in large enough numbers can pose a threat to our nation. We face their wrath now. They gather in [place_where_the_intolerant_will_emerge.GetName] and demand that their idol be placed above all others. Of course, we could never respectably indulge such a request. After careful consideration [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to…"
 idolatrous_events.4.a: "Teach them tolerance."
 idolatrous_events.4.b: "Accept their demands."
 idolatrous_events.4.c: "Let the faithful sort them out."
 idolatrous_events.5.t: "Absolute Authority"
 idolatrous_events.5.d: "The authority of the chieftain is key in Idolatrous society. The Gods respect those who wield power and give them gifts. The authority of a chieftain is determined by their ability to do this and their capacity to rule over the tribe. Throughout the history of our people, many great chieftains have risen and fell. Their influence has never been felt for more than a generation, yet stories of their accomplishments have survived to this day. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s expertise has led many to consider [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] worthy of praise. No doubt, far into the future, many in our nation will remember [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] great deeds and inspire to be like them."
 idolatrous_events.5.a: "Above all others."
 idolatrous_events.6.t: "The Western God"
 idolatrous_events.6.d: "In the west, among the people of Arabia and Iran, there is a belief in one god above all others. Allah God is said to have made the universe and all those below him. He is said to have molded man and set him free. He is said to have caused a great flood and ended the prosperity of those that came before. There are many who follow this Allah God, among them are the Sunnites and Shia. These groups often come into conflict over disagreements in practice of worship. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been forced to intervene during a particularly brutal skirmish between these two groups. No resolution can be found unless [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sides with one of them. After carefully considering the options [Root.Monarch.GetName] decides to…"
 idolatrous_events.6.a: "Side with the Sunnites."
 idolatrous_events.6.b: "Side with the Shia."
 idolatrous_events.7.t: "The Christs"
 idolatrous_events.7.d: "Our neighbors believe in the strangest things. They claim that the Gods have punished man for their mistakes. If we continue to advance in the way we have, they say that we will be punished once again. They speak of a great flood which wiped out humanity. We know of no such thing, yet their message has resonated with some of our pious citizens. The idols of their Gods have begun to be placed alongside the ones that our ancestors worshiped. In a show of good faith towards these folk, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to take up worship of one of the Gods. Out of the many options [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] chose…"

 idolatrous_events.7.e: "Ohlord"
 idolatrous_events.7.f: "Father"
 idolatrous_events.8.t: "Many Faces"
 idolatrous_events.8.d: "Among the Endeans there are many Gods. Any attempt to categorize them all has led to confusion, frustration, and, eventually, failure. There are just too many individual idols and variations of them to understand. We have prided ourselves on this fact. Among the followers of the faith in our borders, there are many who believe in the existence of tiers of these deities. While there are thousands of minor Gods, there are just a few major Gods who stand above the rest. Among them are  Ganesha, Ganga, Shakti, Shiva, and Vishnu. It has grown customary for a ruler to take on one of these Gods to guide their reign. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has carefully considered the options and selected…"

 idolatrous_events.8.f: "Surya"
 idolatrous_events.8.g: "Vishnu"
 idolatrous_events.9.t: "Inward Thought"
 idolatrous_events.9.d: "The Chinese separate themselves from the other idolatrous in the nature of their Gods. While the Endeans may believe that their Gods can control particular aspects of the natural world, few would say they embody them completely. Among the Chinese, there is a belief that the very forces of nature are guided by the will of Gods. Streams flow through the will of the river God and the thunder booms at the will of the rain God. Among the most peculiar of this flavor of belief are the Budites. They state that one can become one with the Gods through internal reflection and perfection. The practice of this type of belief has slowly grown more popular among the faithful. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has even begun to get involved, personally dedicating time for meditation. Out of the three schools of this Budity, [Root.Monarch.GetName] aligned themselves with…"

 idolatrous_events.9.b: "Theravada"
 idolatrous_events.9.c: "Vajrayana"
 idolatrous_events.10.t: "Harmony"
 idolatrous_events.10.d: "Relations between the Gods dictate the lives of men. When the Gods fight, men suffer. When the Gods feast, men gain. This is the wisdom which the elders have passed down to us through their many years. Through offering our time and worship, we can bring harmony to the Gods. These are the thoughts of our people. While the tribes of the west may believe that man can have little to no influence on the actions of the Gods, we know better. Meditation, reflection, and reverence will usher in our prosperity. It is now time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to claim this gift of prosperity and embrace harmony."
 idolatrous_events.10.a: "Embrace the Harmony"
 idolatrous_events.10.b: "We have many faults"
