 sagrado_rebels_name: "Sagrado Zealots"
 sagrado_rebels_desc: "These rebels are radical Sagrados which desire for our state to follow their crooked outlook."
 sagrado_rebels_army: "Zealot Army"
 SAGRADO_ASPECTS_LONG: "Sagrado Aspect"
 SAGRADO_ASPECTS_SHORT: "aspect"
 anima_sola_sagr: "Anima Sola"
 desc_anima_sola_sagr: "Purgatory plays a much more prominent role in Sagratismo than other Christian traditions. Rather than seeing purgatory as a sometimes necessary step on the road to salvation, many Sagradistas believe that the state is a necessary last trial. Eternal fire is said to purify one’s soul during this time and prepare them for eternal life with the Father. This belief is best encapsulated in Anima Sola, a common representation of the souls of purgatory. Shrines to Anima Sola are littered throughout the Sagrado world and often prayed to so that the dearly departed do not suffer in the afterlife."
 frontier_theology_sagr: "Frontier Theology"
 desc_frontier_theology_sagr: "Far beyond the grip of the pope, on the frontiers of the Catholic faith, Sagratismo emerged as a blend between the Espiritismo faiths of the jungle and the Catholic zeal of the early Colombian kingdoms. The promises of the Sagrado faith called to these free spirits. The wonder of a mystical world and a fire in their hearts drew them to convert. They added to the faith, styling elements after what they encountered and who they spoke to. The lingering influence of these pioneers can be felt in the very fabric of the Sagratismo."
 healing_hands_sagr: "Healing Hands"
 desc_healing_hands_sagr: "One of the core sacraments of the Sagrado faith is the anointing of the sick. Its prominence rose out of an abundance of practice, as the Colombian frontier was rife with disease. The traditionally Espiritisimo Curanderos found themselves healing their Catholic oppressors. Over time, the healers shared their traditional remedies which were then adopted as part of Sagrado anointment."
 ocean_baptism_sagr: "Ocean Baptism"
 desc_ocean_baptism_sagr: "Unlike most other Christian traditions, Sagradistas opt for their baptisms to be performed in the sea. In the early days of the faith, most converts were gathered in the city of Maracaibo. To avoid persecution for their beliefs, the Sagradistas would swim far from the shore and perform the baptisms in the dead of night. Some of the first members of the Sagrado faith were dunked into the waters of the Venezuelan Gulf. To this day, faithful Sagradistas will make pilgrimages to the coast in order to get a proper baptism."
 grace_through_fire_sagr: "Grace Through Fire"
 desc_grace_through_fire_sagr: "Deeds bring one closer to salvation. What deed is more noble than fighting for The Lord? To secure a place for their souls in heaven, the men of our country must raise their arms and combat forces of evil. To fight for such a cause makes men noble, restrained, and cordial in times of war. No longer will we face unrelenting bloodshed that we saw during the collapse of the empire."
 apostolic_ambivalence_sagr: "Apostolic Ambivalence"
 desc_apostolic_ambivalence_sagr: "While Tepeyac and Rome may be obsessed with their ancestry and relation to Peter, Sagradistas rarely worry about such petty things. Bishops are the religious leaders of the Sagrado faith who derive their authority from their divine gifts. Becoming a bishop typically happens through nebulous means, either through appointment by an existing bishop or through community consensus. To be a bishop is to be a shepherd, leading the souls of your flock to salvation. Not every shepard must descend from Noah, why must every bishop descend from Peter?"
 tolerated_heretics_sagr: "Tolerated Heretics"
 desc_tolerated_heretics_sagr: "The impromptu nature of many Sagrado churches on the frontier led to the development of an interesting tradition: café de misa. Through an intricate process of blowing hot air over mature beans, Sagrado bishops would create an incredibly light coffee which held an almost red hue. During the sacrament of the Eucharist, frontier Colombians would consume this liquid in lieu of the traditional wine. This practice was intensely criticized by Tepeyac and led to the excommunication of many bishops who would go on to found the Sagrado faith."
 stimulating_communion_sagr: "Stimulating Communion"
 desc_stimulating_communion_sagr: "Tepeyac may rant and rave about the supposed “heresy” of Sagrado practices, but most of our Catholic brethren accept us as family. To them we are simply misguided. This has routinely aided Sagradistas in their efforts to ally themselves with other faiths. When threatened by the Brazilian menace in the south, it was not the so-called leader of Christendom who protected the Colombians, but the emperor of Guadalupe. Brothers under Christ, we will face the pagans and come out on the other side."
 earned_scripture_sagr: "Earned Scripture"
 desc_earned_scripture_sagr: "As a measure to fully detach the Sagradistas from Christendom, the pope of Tepeyac enacted a papal bull preventing the transfer of scripture south of Panama. The limited supply of Colombian bibles and lack of spanish-speakers in the region led to a religious crisis for our faith. It was only with the advent of the printing press in the 16th century that the Sagrado faith was able to recover and grow in its examination of the scripture. We must never forget this great sin of Tepeyac."
 idolic_approach_sagr: "Idolic Approach"
 desc_idolic_approach_sagr: "Sagratismo is a faith of Colombians first and foremost. It was founded by frontiersmen in the Amazon and Llanos, embraced by the elders of Bogota, and spread by the descendants of Muisca. For this reason, the Sagrado faith is laden with icons of the old Colombian empire. Statues of the Gran Vultur stand above the entrances to Sagrado churches. Inside, they are tinted green as the sun streams in through emerald windows."
 bishop_control_sagr: "Bishop Control"
 desc_bishop_control_sagr: "During the southern crusade, Tepeyac quickly appointed a handful of priests to bishophood in order to convert the Colombian people. This collection of bishops became incredibly influential during the golden age of the empire, but ultimately fell into irrelevance once it collapsed. Their many descendants became dissatisfied with Tepeyac’s lackluster help during the crisis and started to practice independently of the papacy. Through their actions, the earliest forms of the Sagrado faith began to emerge."
 the_sacred_heart_sagr: "The Sacred Heart"
 desc_the_sacred_heart_sagr: "Salva a tu pueblo, Señor, y bendice tu heredad.\nSé su pastor y ensálzalo eternamente.\n\nSave your people, Lord, and bless your inheritance.\nShepherd them and raise them to eternal life."

 sagrado_flavor.1.t: "The Heart Grows Fonder"
 sagrado_flavor.1.d: "In the dark corners of the jungle, far away from Tepeyac’s prying eyes, the frontiersmen of Colombia fashioned themselves into national heroes. All across the collapsing empire, these noble souls would be revered alongside kings. Yet, unlike the kings, the frontiersmen practiced a form of our Catholic faith which astounded many of the more religiously inclined. Through deep conversation with academics and bishops, we have come to understand their worship. They brand themselves Sagradistas after the Sacred Heart of the Savior. Their Sagrado faith has been roundly denounced by Tepeyac for its supposed heresy. Despite this, many of our own citizens have come to embrace it fully. Even stranger, some of our previously pious bishops have converted to the faith and now denounce the very foundation of Tepeyac’s authority. His Eminence continues to turn a blind eye to the problems of our region, barely lifting a finger to assist in this religious strife. If He was not here to aid us when the empire collapsed or when disease plagued our cities, who is to say he would suddenly come to our rescue now? Perhaps it is time to reconsider who truly represents the will of heaven."
 sagrado_flavor.1.a: "We Are Alone."
 sagrado_flavor.1.b: "We Will Make Do."
 sagrado_flavor.2.t: "Faith Fractionalism"
 sagrado_flavor.2.d: "Grave news has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] from Colombia. The once pious region has fallen to a terrible heresy known as Sagratismo. Founded by sorcerers of the jungle and demonic influence, their faith practices dark worship which has no place in the Christian world. Worse yet, many of our own bishops have come to join their practice and denounce our primacy. They have recognized our declining influence as a sign of weakness and pounced on the opportunity to lead their people astray. We must remain firm in our faith and call upon all proper Catholics of the world to correct this error. Colombia must be brought back into the light, lest it falters in the dark."
 sagrado_flavor.2.a: "Horror!"
 explaining_sagrado_and_the_problems.tt: "Nations in §YColombia§! will begin to convert to §YSagrado§!. Each nation that converts will decrease Papal Authority by §R-0.5%§!. Nations that remain Catholic will increase Papal Authority by §G+0.5%§!"
 sagrado_flavor.3.t: "A Commanding Bishop"
 sagrado_flavor.3.d: "While we normally appreciate the help of bishops in guiding our faith, sometimes the power can go to their heads. We now suffer from this exact problem, as a prominent bishop in [Root.Capital.GetName] has begun to denounce the actions of our administration on religious grounds. He has claimed that so far, we have ruled over our nation in a papist manner which is unfitting for a Sagrado ruler. Even more worrying, he even suggests that we are still in league with Tepeyac. These statements might damage the reputation of our administration. Of course, silencing this bishop would be a breach of our divide between church and state, but such an action would be justified on the grounds that he breached this divide first. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that our subjects would view it that way. We must carefully decide how we wish to proceed in order to save face and prevent further damage to our reputation."
 sagrado_flavor.3.a: "Assert our Authority."
 sagrado_flavor.3.b: "Let the Bishop Command."
 sagrado_flavor.4.t: "Saint Struggles"
 sagrado_flavor.4.d: "Saints occupy a special space within Sagrado society. Not quite authoritative enough to be bishops, but holy enough to warrant praise, ascent to sainthood is a rare occurrence. For this reason, those that are beautified garner more praise than the holy men of other Christian traditions. A particularly holy individual has finally passed away within our nation. Most of our populace now murmurs of their supposed sainthood and expects an official declaration from our administration. Our approach to this situation could set a precedent for the authority of our state. We could go with the standard option of letting a bishop beautify the individual, beautify the saint ourselves, or even let our citizens decide who is worthy of worship through their actions."
 sagrado_flavor.4.a: "We will Beautify."
 sagrado_flavor.4.b: "It is a bishop's job."
 sagrado_flavor.4.c: "Who are we to decide who is a saint?"
 sagrado_flavor.5.t: "Fresh Belief"
 sagrado_flavor.5.d: "Since our conversion to the Sagrado faith, our nation has buzzed with religious fervor. The active sacraments and vibrant praise, that is derived from our tradition, makes religion a much larger part of our citizens’s lives. Yet, even now, this fervor is beginning to die down. In order to ensure that we continue to hold this reverence into future generations, some in our administration have suggested that we embark on a program of encouragement. By diverting a portion of our nation’s resources to the clergy, we could revive our fervor through developing religious institutions throughout our country."
 sagrado_flavor.5.a: "We must inspire this generation!"
 sagrado_flavor.5.b: "This is not our problem."
 sagrado_flavor.6.t: "Espiritismo Syncretism"
 sagrado_flavor.6.d: "Tepeyac has claimed many things about our faith, few of them are true. We do not worship devils, nor do we practice dark magic. However, there are fragments of truth in even the most blatant lies. Tepeyac claims that our faith was inspired by the savages of the jungle, a fact which we have made no effort to conceal from our people. The Espiritias have repeatedly served as an inspiration to parts of our faith indirectly, yet some of our citizens have begun to take this inspiration a little too literally. In the province of [espiritismo_syncretism_prov_sagr.GetName], our citizens have begun to convert to the Espiritismo faith. We must do something to ensure that the unity of our state is maintained."
 sagrado_flavor.6.a: "There is nothing we can do."
 sagrado_flavor.6.b: "Correct their worship."
 sagrado_flavor.7.t: "State Sagrado"
 sagrado_flavor.7.d: "From the foundation of the Sagratismo, there has been a struggle between the church and state for supremacy over the faith. While the Catholics had centuries of negotiations to set relations, we have no such luxury. In order to advance our interests, some in our administration have suggested that we manually encourage the belief in State Sagrado. This tradition espouses that it is the divinely selected rulers, not any wayward bishop or “holy man”, who should pass judgment on matters of faith. Of course, we could spread the message ourselves, but we just as easily grease the palms of some pliable bishops to get across our message."
 sagrado_flavor.7.a: "Encourage this view."
 sagrado_flavor.7.b: "Have the Bishops teach this message."
 sagrado_flavor.7.c: "It is not our position to decide."
