 creating_a_aegean_fleet_title: "Preparing an Eastern Fleet"
 creating_a_aegean_fleet_desc: "In the lands of the west the historic Louisian league has held sway over trade in these fair tides for uncountable generations. We have begun their downfall with the capture of Thrace under Usman I, but there is still a ways left to go. In order to properly wage war against these maritime peoples we will need a modern navy. Constructing several fine galleys within our ports would surely make us competitive against their raw strength."
 heart_of_the_hellas_title: "Heart of the Hellas"
 heart_of_the_hellas_desc: "The Louisian League bases its operations around the city of St.Louis. The first step to the domination of this region is capturing that city. However the warden of the city, the serene republic of Saint Louis, are rich beyond imagining. While their own armies may be weak compared to our mighty buckeyes, Plainwalker and Mexican mercenaries might quickly fill their ranks. Upon the capture of the city we can repurpose it as a capital of westward expansion into the rest of the three cities region."
 the_prariemen_title: "The Hellaldans"
 the_prariemen_desc: "The western part of the Hellas is dominated by the Hellaldans, a more historically mixed group of people. The great eastern migration of Peter and his followers nearly 1200 years ago saw a radical restructuring of the east. However before that point the American Empire had been trading with the tribes of the Hellas for hundreds of years. The people on these western shores of the Hellas adopted cultural elements of the Americans with whom they traded with. Even the general name of the region, the Hellas, comes from those same Americans. Tapping into this historical legacy, taking this region would allow us to go forward and trade with the West."
 the_mighty_spartans_title: "The Mighty Spartans"
 the_mighty_spartans_desc: "During the life of Usman I, the Spartans proved to be a continuous threat. Tribes of Cincinnati, Dayton, Indianapolis, Louisville, and Appalachia all hired these foriegn soldiers. The Spartans have a contradictory existence. Bordered by sea and powerful states they have been at war only a few times during their state’s existence. However, despite this, they maintain a rigid society of warriors who often sell themselves into mercenary service. The fight for the island will be difficult, but ultimately necessary if we wish to unite the Hellas."
 dismantling_the_senate_title: "Impeaching the Senate"
 dismantling_the_senate_desc: "The city of Chicago has held a long and sorted history. Originally founded by the disciple Peter on his journey to Canada, it holds particular religious significance to the sacramental faiths. It was also the capital of the old Iowan caliphate before its collapse. Now it lies in ruin, a bitterly divided state under a set of constantly bickering senators. It is our job to restore order to this most holy city and give it the rule it deserves."
 fill_government_positions_title: "Prepare the Institutions"
 fill_government_positions_desc: "With our new state comes a series of positions that need to be filled. When Usman I united the Ohio peninsula he created a set of institutions that held heavy autonomy and power but would work to operate parts of his state which he was not gifted in. Among these were the Siphahi Collective, the Bashaw Club, the Ulama Council, and the Buckeye Order. The task of filling these roles will be costly, but as Usman’s successor it is our task to ensure that they are occupied."
 renew_the_caliphate_titles_title: "Renew Titles"
 renew_the_caliphate_titles_desc: "Filling our courts will not only work to help our administration thrive under our own reign, but under the reign of our heirs as well. When transitioning to a new administration we have the option of adopting the previous administration’s positions. During the reign of Usman I he famously issued the Pact of Indianapolis, which established these four fundamental decisions. Under this founding document if a certain administration’s institutions are carried forward into the next they are allowed to pick their own successors. Essentially this allows us to pass our administration’s leaders to our kin without having to rebuild these institutions around new people."
 stacking_the_courts_title: "Stacking the Courts"
 stacking_the_courts_desc: "Our journey to complete the courts is nearing completion but we should be advised in warning our prodigy about overreliance on their forefather’s choices. The most disastrous moment during Usman I’s rule was the great Silkpetal rebellion in which the Buckeye Vizier attempted to overthrow the government while the sultan was suffering from a long fever. Luckily, the Sipahi Yakup intervened. In the future it would be wise to keep an eye on the institutions and not let them stay for too long."
 a_packed_administration_title: "A Packed Administration"
 a_packed_administration_desc: "Our courts are almost full, but it would do us well to complete their ranks. Under our reign Ulama will work with Bashaw and Sipahi will work with Buckeye. The petty differences of rank and trade will melt away, bringing unto their true identity as Ohioans."
 the_virginian_massacre_title: "The Virginian Massacre"
 the_virginian_massacre_desc: "The house of Virginia is as old as Antebella. When the apostle Peter arrived at Toronto he was greeted by a delegation bearing the name Virginia with gifts of “pipe and tea.” The title of Virginia has evolved over time, but some members still hold that they can trace their lineage back to the original men who met with the famed disciple. In modern times the Viriginian house remains divided amongst various prinicpalities. Their fragmentation will be our boon."
 the_board_is_set_title: "The Board is Set"
 the_board_is_set_desc: "Our most potent area for expansion lies in the east with the region of Antebella. During the reign of Usman I we fought with these disparate people in Fredrick’s War in order to prevent total Canadian Great Lake domination. Now times have changed and the throne of the north looks shaky as their emperor ages. The heathens in our west now serve as a barrier to trade and expansion rather than a protective ally. Our course of action is clear then, we must prepare for total Antebellum domination."
 the_betrayl_at_asheville_title: "The Betrayl at Asheville"
 the_betrayl_at_asheville_desc: "As we prepare for war, an unlikely ally reaches out to us. The duke of Asheville has been in talks with several Buckeye operatives to defect to the Buckeye cause. A traditionally pious Muslim who has recently faced opression from the court of Charlotte, the duke has been an advocate for the idea of sultan rule. Immediately upon the declaration of war he has promised to bolster our armies and provide pivotal information regarding weaknesses in most Carolinian cities."
 conquest_of_the_carolinians_title: "Conquest of Carolina"
 conquest_of_the_carolinians_desc: "The Locklears of Carolina have traditionally been hostile to the Buckeyes. During their wars for dominance over Ohio the Locklears supported an uprising in Appalachia and offered mercenaries to the resisting tribes of Kentucky. Further, during Fredrick’s War a large portion of Carolinian troops pillaged through the countryside of the peninsula on their way to defend Chicago. The utter lack of respect shown to our almighty sultan can only be met with one thing: fire and fury. "
 tidewater_dominence_title: "Tidewater Dominence"
 tidewater_dominence_desc: "Great tidewater breezes blow across the plains of Carolina into those smoky hills of Appalachia and cool the sultan within his very own palace. These breezes fill our sails, our homes, and our hearts. Yet, the merchants of the outer banks work to ensure that they stay out of our pockets. The tidewater sea and its respective trade would provide a lucrative source of income that our growing state dearly needs, it only makes sense that we would go forward and claim it."
 game_set_match_title: "Game Set Match"
 game_set_match_desc: "Our quest to unite the kingdom of Antebella has succeeded, but ruling is often more difficult than conquest. These men are of foreign birth, foreign religion, and foriegn creed. If we are to introduce them into the fold it perhaps might be wise to enlist the help of the house of Virginia which we have just snubbed. First however we must ensure that the Locklears will not rise again to challenge whatever autonomy we give."
 ohio_events.1007.t: "The Virginian Proposal"
 ohio_events.1007.d: "The lands of Antebella have become a hassle to manage. The foriegn culture and religion have quickly inspired revolt, so we must go forward with a plan of integration. Far from our home city, over the smokey mountains and rolling hills of Appalachia, the house of Virginia sits in ruin. Shattered, lost of power, but still heavy with influence. These people could serve a potential great use for our cause. We could reenlist these men into our ranks, force them to convert, appoint them as Wali, and have them rule lands throughout the region. Under their reign the populace would be more open to conversion and slower to revolt. However, we should be mindful that with increased influence perhaps they may aspire for a return to their old status."

 ohio_events.1008.t: "The Reign of Usman"
 ohio_events.1008.d: "Great Usman II, son of the man who united these lands, has a great task laid out before him. In the west, Hellenic traders wait eagerly for his collapse. In the east, the lands of Antebella lie undefended and ripe for conquest. In the north, The Great Maple Throne now plots for his undoing. The administration of his father has mostly fallen into ruin with corrupt officials filling the ranks as the Sultan aged. The army grows restless as a lack of conquest has left them without training for years. The economy sputters as the once blooming Great Lakes trade dries up. It is up to the job of Usman II to rebuild the courts, defeat his enemies, and claim the Great Lakes for Ohio."

 ohio_events.1010.t: "A New Sultan"
 ohio_events.1010.d: "With a new sultan comes the necessity for a new administration. The choice must be decided between carrying over the advisors of the last administration or filling the ranks with completely new ones. During the reign of Usman I a decree known as the “Pact of Indianapolis” established that once a sultan had chosen the leading figures in an administration that said administration had the ability to operate with autonomy and chose their own successors. For us, this means that we can either choose to keep our forefather’s administration or to fill the courts with our own nobles. It should be noted that long term institution independence ought to be avoided in order to prevent total corruption."

During the reign of Usman I a decree known as the “Pact of Indianapolis” established that once a sultan had chosen the leading figures in an administration that said administration had the ability to operate with autonomy and chose their own successors. The institutions we have entrenched from the last administration now demand their further autonomy. Holding it back from them will not only cause our rule to be mired in dissidents from the previous institutions, but will greatly damage our stability. However, if we were to let them keep their place we could very well face an insurrection! My sultan, the choice is yours. "

 ohio_events.1012.t: "The Buckeye Coup"
 ohio_events.1012.d: "Dark times have befallen our great state. Upon the death of our beloved sultan, fearing the dissolution of their titles, the administration revolted. The Buckeye Vizier and Sipahi Captain in coordination charged towards the capital. The Grand Ulama and Kaaba Custodian drafted a joint fatwa proclaiming the old Sultan’s rule and government as tyrannical. Selim Halil, one of the senior members of the Buckeye order, was crowned within the hour. Our great heir is nowhere to be found, having either fled or been killed at the hands of the rebelling masses. A new banner was raised over the great city of Columbus, not the one of the lion which had fearlessly dominated the valley, but one of the Buckeye."

 ohio_events.1019.t: "Sipahi Dissidents"
 ohio_events.1019.d: "Rebellious hordes now wait for our Vizier’s downfall! After the Buckeye Coup several institutional lords were upset at their new treatment. Most had gone forward with the coup expecting higher positions in the new administration, but were surprised to find themselves often with lesser titles. A group of these lords have not banded together with the Sipahi in order to attempt yet another Coup. They now march throughout our lands, staking claim to every small town and city outside of our army’s reach. They ready themselves for the time of total revolt."

The disparate groups within our borders needed representation and in order to do that Usman created several key bureaucratic institutions which would operate with autonomy in the matters of their respective field.  Among these groups was the Bashaw Club. When Usman I first united these lands, he did so by conquering several older tribes. These tribes held heavy ties to the land and as such were especially intertwined with its management. In order to prevent uprisings, Usman created a special council of these former families known as the Bashaw club. By the Sultan’s grace, these noble families would then be given a say in how their former cities were managed.\n\nIn order for our state to operate efficiently, we must delegate a share of our power to this influential group.

Their order has historically stayed insular, but with the recent expansion of the Ohio state they have been thrust into the royal army. The Sipahi gained most of their notoriety during the Silkpetal rebellion, during which they soundly defeated the ornery nobles of the south without clear instruction of the Sultan. As a reward, many of these men were granted the ability to farm taxes off of a number of southern realms.

In the time before the arrival of Peter and the formation of the American Empire the region had the most sophisticated civilization on the continent. In modern times it has fallen into ruin, under the thumb of different rulers and changing faiths. If we were to claim this ancient land as our own, we could learn much from the knowledge amongst the rubble."

During a time before Christ had saved the Evangelicals, it was said that he had guided the armies of Dixie through Carolina and even across the sea to unite Antebella. Those who still cling to the Evangelical faith and fill our ranks have begun to view our next campaign target of England with this same religious reverence. The lands of England are wooded and vast, it would do us good to have the legends of old shadow our campaign."

 rebuilding_land_of_antiquity_desc: "The lands of Canaan have fallen into disrepair as of late. The roads of antiquity are now crumbled and barely traversable. The cities have only ruins of churches to convert into mosques. With the new technological innovations of our age it would do well to improve these lands with manufactories. The lands of Canaan were historically renowned for their premium universities, where scholars from throughout not just America but also Mexico would come and learn. Rebuilding these bedrock institutions would allow the area to not only be more manageable, but profitable in the long run."

 capitalize_off_the_interior_trade_desc: "In the times of Usman I we held an iron grip over trade in the Great Lakes. However after the Wisconsin defeat during Fredrick’s war, much has changed. The Maple Throne imposed strict trade barriers on every nation which they defeated, preventing us from earning off of our latent trade. With our new size it would be easy to strike out against these restrictions and claim all the ducats for ourselves."

 the_green_wall_desc: "Pierce Lafayette, father of Fredrick, described the lands of the Iowan caliphate as a “Green Wall.” This description comes from the difference in churches and mosques across towns. In towns north of the Caliphate, the roofs of churches would be painted a myriad of different colors, however in the Caliphate the mosques had a distinct green color. This green wall moniker was adopted as a symbol of pride by the Caliphate, and seeing as we are their descendants it would be only right for us to reclaim the lands part of this “Green Wall.”"

 reclaim_the_northern_colonies_desc: "In the reign of Usman I, the autonomy of individuals in our state had been much greater in relation to trade. This fact led one merchant, Abu Al-Aziz, to go forward and engage in aggressive commerce for the Sultan. It was by the sword of his mercenaries that the island of Tennessee was conquered and his banner that islands of Ionia fell under the Sultan’s reign. During the latter part of his life, as the institution of slavery slowly faded into obscurity following the Quebec proclamation of 1409, he attempted to conquer Florida. His mission still lives on within our minds, and with the island of Georgia under our hold, a conquest of Florida would be an easy task."

The Quebecois were one of the original peoples of the region before the arrival of Peter and bitterly fought against inclusion in the foriegn state. Conquest of this region will also net us large gains in trade as the Quebecois are the major merchant force along the Lawrence.

After the death of Peter the region was integrated into the empire through a series of bloody wars. Ever since there has been a hands off approach to governing the region, which has left the maritime lords fat with trade income. They have spent this income for the past 200 years wrestling to colonize the northern bay.

When Pierce Lafayette died, there was a succession crisis in the Maple Throne. His oldest son, Jaxon, was of our prophet’s faith and thus was cast out of the state. These woods for that reason are under the careful eye of the Maple Throne, and should be approached with caution lest we incite a grand conflict."

 ohio_events.1009.d: "With our decision to integrate the house of Virginia into our ranks, we have made the fatal error in trusting an Antebellan. In a petition signed by 14 different members of the house, we have been asked to give the state of Jefferson vassalage status rather than total domination. Ostensibly, this would greatly decrease our influence over the region, but prevent total revolt of the Virginians. However, were we to deny their pleas we would face open revolution and increased hostility from the region for the foreseeable future. The choice is yours my Sultan."

 ohio_events.1018.t: "A Dispute In Albany"
 ohio_events.1018.d: "The conquest of the Upstate has brought with it the usual problems that come with ruling. Typically these would be handled by locally installed beys, but in the case of Albany there has been fierce debate. The subject of disagreement is the Ancient House of Albany, a structure which is said to have predated the earliest of Canaanite civilizations. Over the years it has been converted to various different structures with it currently being a church of the Dynastic faith. Most recently riots have broken out in the streets of Albany over the bitter conflict of what shall be its new role. Three petitioners have brought forward proposals. The Dynastic side is simple, keep the chapel as it is. The Jewish side pledges to convert the chapel to its original state as a synagogue. Finally the side of our prophet encourages us to convert the chapel to a mosque. Whatever the choice, you will undoubtedly provoke anger from another side."

 ohio_events.1013.t: "The Great Lakes Company"
 ohio_events.1013.d: "Throughout the existence of our united state there has been a consistent battle between the independence of trade and centralized control. The Kentucker traditions of the south have guided this conflict, and its impacts are starting to creep into our new domination of the lake's interior. Specifically, out of Indianapolis a series of guilds have thrown their weight together to establish the “Ohio Company.” This trade organization models itself off of those of Canadian orientation in the Hudson and Lawrence. Their role in increasing our trade potential in the lakes is undeniable, but if we were to directly manage them the income could be immense. Currently the company has halted their activities to avoid having to pay greater tithes, so it would be the perfect opportunity to make a decisive decision about their legitimacy. Shall we let them continue to operate in independence, or govern them ourselves?"

 ohio_events.1017.t: "The Question Of Slavery"
 ohio_events.1017.d: "When Usman I founded our great nation, he did so during a phenomenally different time than ours. During his day the practice of slavery was widespread amongst the great lakes, primarily of the Northern Floridians who would readily sell their southern neighbors into the slave trade. However, with the proclamation of 1409 by The Maple Throne, the institution of slavery has slowly fallen apart. With our conquest of these northern colonies, we are met with a new challenge. There has been no official ruling on the subject of slavery since these times long ago, and many rich lords now salivate over the prospect of renewing the trade in the great lakes. Our great domininence could cause a rebirth in the slave trade throughout the region, but is that truly what the prophet would intend?"

 ohio_events.1015.t: "The Canadian Colonial Machine"
 ohio_events.1015.d: "The Canadian state has long held a tradition of colonization, whether that be during the times of Peter in the island of Nova Scotia or our modern ones with the conquest of Greenland. We now lie at a point in which the Canadian colonial machine has started to falter with our invasion. Focusing on reinvigorating this colonial spirit could carry the prophet’s word across the seas and into the lands of the west. With this focus we shall ensure that whatever possessions across the seas the Canadians flee to will fall as well."

 ohio_events.1014.t: "A Fight Over Ice"
 ohio_events.1014.d: "An ongoing problem we have encountered in conquering these lands is the amount of issues that are latent in the soil. In the far north we have inherited the problem of the Grandbay-Hudson conflict. During the early years of Fredrick’s rule, the Maritime expansion into the Hudson Bay reached a peak with the colonization of the western coast. Frederick, in the middle of the war for the lands of Canaan, proclaimed that the region would not be ruled as a maritime territory, but instead as one of Ontario or Quebec. This greatly angered the local lords, who revolted and ever since have competed with the Hudson company over control of the gulf. Now that we have united the region, it is our job to choose one of the factions to control the gulf."

 ohio_events.1016.t: "Moving the Caliph's Palace"
 ohio_events.1016.d: "With the realm of Canada under our belt it comes time to decide how we shall procead. The city of Toronto would provide our Caliph a central and historic location to rule our territory from. Toronto itself features the palace of The Maple Throne, which would undoubtedly be a suitable replacement for the palace in Columbus. The city is also located at the crossroads of the largest trade network on the continent, so shifting our influence to its waters would provide an incredible benefit. However leaving the land of our origins would certainly upset the families whose roots had been entrenched in its soil for generations. The choice is ultimately a difficult one, and up to my Caliph."
