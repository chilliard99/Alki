 zahran_events.1.t: "Amunterasu"
 zahran_events.1.d: "Shinto, or at least the Riewa incarnation of the religion, is a faith centered around the kami. These Kami each represent aspects of the natural world like the moon, storms, or even general prosperity. Among the Kami, none are more revered than Amaterasu. As the kami of the sun and patron kami of the ancient Riewa dynasty, Amaterasu has routinely been the most widely venerated and known of the nature spirits. Among some of the more radical members of Shinto society, Amaterasu is exclusively worshiped in a manner similar to our own Amun. Some of our Shinto citizens have started to worship both as single grand kami known as “Amunterasu.” If we were to promote this belief, it would undoubtedly push us closer towards blending our faiths. On the other hand, maintaining their differences would instill further Ma’at within our people."
 zahran_events.1.a: "Of course, they are one in the same!"
 zahran_events.1.b: "Not our amun."
 zahran_events.2.t: "Purity of the Waters"
 zahran_events.2.d: "An important aspect of Shinto is its focus on purity. Among its practitioners, ritual cleansing and the avoidance of impurity is one of the top priorities. Unlike our neighbors, we do not have this same reliance on purity. Instead, us Zahran believe that the waters of the world, our souls, and our futures have been cleansed through the gentle work of Amun. This sense of purity has resonated with our Shinto citizens as we continue to blend our two religions. With this purity comes reflection, the direction of which is up to us to decide. Will we use this moment to bring us closer to each other, add to our Ma’at, or even support our own rule."
 zahran_events.2.a: "It will bring us closer"
 zahran_events.2.b: "It will make us just"
 zahran_events.2.c: "It will support our rule"
 zahran_events.3.t: "Zahran Shrines"
 zahran_events.3.d: "For those that follow the Shinto faith, shrines are places to gather and reflect. Throughout the northern isles of Japan, there are thousands of shrines which each hold different kami and serve as community centers. Similar to this, Zahran pyramids serve as places of worship and monuments to the great god Amun. Our process of blending with the Shinto faith has led to the creation of Zahran shrines, which are said to hold aspects of Amun. While this is antithetical to the belief of Amun as one indivisible god, it has worked to tie in their faith closer to ours. Shutting down this practice may place us on the righteous path, but keeping it might aid in our blending efforts."
 zahran_events.3.a: "Let it continue"
 zahran_events.3.b: "Heresy!"
 zahran_events.4.t: "Papal Taint"
 zahran_events.4.d: "The Pope of Tepeyac holds a powerful legitimacy through holding his ancient title. Even those who do not believe in his supremacy still respect his authority on matters of religious judgment. Whether Catholic, Evangelical, or even Espiritismo, most Christians have positive opinions on the pope. Throughout time, the influence of Tepeyac has waxed and waned. Throughout our attempts to blend the two religions of Zahra and Christianity, we have met resistance from our Christian citizens who cling to the authoritative influence of the pope. Someday, the Catholics of our nation will be free from the dominating influence of his eminence."
 zahran_events.4.a: "Troubling..."
 zahran_events.5.t: "Amungod"
 zahran_events.5.d: "The god of Christianity shares many similarities with our Amun. Both are all powerful eternal beings who created and preserve the world. However, the minor differences that the two figures do share have led to great strife between our faiths. This fact has given our nation significant trouble in the process of blending our two religions. Our Christian citizens are still entrenched in their old mindsets and cannot see Amun as the true Allgod. As has been done by other nations in the past, we could blend together Amun with the Christian god to make our religion more palatable. Spreading around the existence of this Amungod would no doubt generate controversy related to its heresy, but it would be a powerful tool in ensuring the blending between Christianity and Zahra."
 zahran_events.5.a: "Enforce his Image"
 zahran_events.5.b: "A Heretical an Useless Effort"
 zahran_events.6.t: "Triple Trouble"
 zahran_events.6.d: "An important aspect of Christianity lies in the existence of the Trinity, a threefold god of equal elements. A complicated subject, the Trinity is one of the central aspects which sets apart Sacramentals from their Christian brothers. This same trinity has caused our nation significant issues as we endeavor to blend together the religions of Zahra and Christianity. Among our nation’s Christians, few are willing to part with the notion that their god is made of three different aspects fused into one being. Of course, Amun within traditional Zahra scripture is seen as a single deity with countless aspects. Restricting this nature and presenting Amun as a figure with three souls would go far in blending together our two religions, but would likely draw outrage from members of our populace for its heresy."
 zahran_events.6.a: "Amun is Amun"
 zahran_events.6.b: "Amun is three souls in one"
 zahran_events.7.t: "Amun-Christ"
 zahran_events.7.d: "Sacramentals hold sacred their evershifting Christ. They believe that Jesus has appeared three times, once in Canaan long ago, another time in Adam-ondi-Ahman, and finally at the Salt Lake. Jesus has led the Sacramentals to glory every time he has appeared, which makes the lack of his presence in Zahra deeply discomforting for our Sacramental citizens. However, our alliance with [amunchrist_for_the_loc.GetName] has presented us with a way to remedy this situation through consulting with their religious experts. Through conversation we have found that presenting Jesus as a reincarnation of Amun would explain many of the faith’s nagging questions and satisfy our Sacramental citizens. This new direction will help us to blend together the two religions."
 zahran_events.7.a: "A Useful Message"
 zahran_events.8.t: "Taking Inerrant Liberties"
 zahran_events.8.d: "The Bible is an old document, changed by thousands of different authors over the ages. When Jesus of the Salt Lake read from the Californian Bible, at its time believed to be the purest version of the text, he was disgusted with the changes. Even his restored version, the Utah Bible, has been changed over time by Ecclesial, Ogdonian, and Theanite authors. It is with this in mind that some of our advisors have suggested that we rewrite certain portions of the bible to allow for easier blending between the Zahra and Sacramental religions. Completing this task will require a lot of work, particularly from our court missionaries, but its success would lead to a much quicker process of bringing the Sacramentals into our faith."
 zahran_events.8.a: "Someone got a pen?"
 zahran_events.8.b: "A Useless Task"
 zahran_events.9.t: "Mystical Interests"
 zahran_events.9.d: "Among the Sacramentals, none are more reviled by members of our nation than the Theanites. Devoted Theanites travel to our borders frequently in order to mock our beliefs with their mystical bastardizations. However, now that we find ourselves with Sacramentals in our own borders we could use this tendency to help blend our religions. By exploiting the mystical and foriengn aspects of our faith and highlighting them to the Sacramentals, we could acclimate them to Zahran beliefs more easily. While doing this would certainly aid in our blending efforts, it would damage our reputation among the more faithful members of our populace."
 zahran_events.9.a: "We are in tune with the world."
 zahran_events.9.b: "Embarassing"
 zahran_events.10.t: "Amun-Allah"
 zahran_events.10.d: "Zahra has always shared deep ties with the Islamic faiths, particularly the Originalists. In ancient times, before the Reiwa conquered the isles, the Zahra faithful called Amun “Allahgod” which eventually evolved into his alternate modern title Allgod. It wasn’t until the Kyushu occupation of the isle that most nations came to consider the Floridan faith as a Japanese religion rather than an Islamic one. Yet, there are still many among our populace that worship a hybrid of the god Amun and Allah. Spreading knowledge of this Amun-Allah could help in our current efforts to blend the two religions, but would likely anger the Islamic nations of the world."
 zahran_events.10.a: "It is the truth!"
 zahran_events.10.b: "Heresy!"
 we_will_anger_all_islamic_nations.tt: "Gain §R-50§! opinion with all Islamic Group nations"
 zahran_events.11.t: "Brothers in Practice"
 zahran_events.11.d: "Zahra’s connection to the Islamic faith emerges from centuries of exchange and coexistence. The first Originalists were said to have emerged from the Egyptians that refused the grace of Amun and stayed in Florida. When Peter and his flock displaced the people of the Great Lakes, most of the Islamic world fled to the island of Florida in order to continue their practice in peace. It was only with the Kyushan conquest of the isles that the Originalists were kicked out and most elements of Islam were removed from the faith. Despite this, the deep ties that still persist between our two faiths ensure that the Islamic members of our nation are open to our blending process."
 zahran_events.11.a: "Eternally Linked"
 zahran_events.12.t: "The Caliph's Interests"
 zahran_events.12.d: "The rise of the Ohio caliph has posed severe problems for our blending of the Islamic faith. After the fall of the Iowan caliphate, the Islamic world was left without leadership. While this led many to lose their practice of the faith, others had their belief reinforced with new devotion. Without a single centralized practice, Islam became a more fluid faith whose practice varied between regions and sects. This environment was greatly conducive to efforts of blending. However, the Ohio caliph’s central leadership and strong position now seeks to diminish our practice. The muslims of our nation cling to their core tenets much more fireclty than in the past. Hopefully, they will give up their fight in time."
 zahran_events.12.a: "Troubling..."
 zahran_events.13.t: "Soul of Liberty"
 zahran_events.13.d: "Among the Constitutionalists, there is nothing more important than the spirit of liberty. Gifted unto man by the Founder, or Amunder as our Constitutionalists call him, it guides the interpretation of the Constitution and course of history. In Zahra, there is no concept which directly relates to this spirit. This fact has heavily troubled some members of our Constitutionalist population as we attempt to blend with their religion. Some in our administration have suggested that we interpret the spirit of liberty as an aspect of Amun’s soul, one which is ever present in ensuring purity. While this concept would greatly benefit our efforts to blend our two religions, it also heavily deviates from the prevailing practice of the Zahran faith. If we were to spread this message, it is likely that it would bring many of our own faithful to question their practice and destabilize our religious authority."
 zahran_events.13.a: "It is Amun's Soul"
 zahran_events.13.b: "A Fake Concept"
 zahran_events.14.t: "Emperor's Strength"
 zahran_events.14.d: "The Emperor, or as the Californians call him “The President,” of the constitutionalists holds great authority. Having been picked by the progeny of the founder, the Soul of Liberty, The Emperor is able to make decisions of matters of the faith and guide the princes that serve beneath them. However, The Emperor’s authority and power over these princes waxes and wanes over time. Currently, The Emperor holds significant sway over his fellow union members. This fact has led many of our own Constitutionalist citizens to be more resistant to our process of blending. Hopefully they will come to break with The Emperor’s total control in time."
 zahran_events.14.a: "Troubling..."
 zahran_events.15.t: "Amun's Cities"
 zahran_events.15.d: "Manhattan, Cleveland, Washington, Philadelphia, and Buffalo serve as the five centers of the Jewish faith. From the times of the New Canaanites until our modern day, any nation that controlled these five cities would have significant control over the Jewish faith. Our conquest of one of the cities has given us significant authority when blending our two religions. Even though the differences between Zahra and Judaism are great, simply holding onto one of their major holy sites has caused our Jewish population to be more accepting of Amun’s glory. Let us continue to cherish this great gift and use its glory to further elevate our worship of Amun. In time, our Jewish population will come to appreciate his divinity and join us in this worship."
 zahran_events.15.a: "Wonderous!"
 zahran_events.16.t: "Canaanite Conversion"
 zahran_events.16.d: "Zahran history has been mired by speculation and pseudo-historical theories. The fate of the Egyptians, an ancient group of Zahrans who were said to have “crossed the seas” to return to their home in the east, is among the most widely speculated of these topics. Some believe that the Egyptians fled east to a land across the waves, others think that they settled on the isle of Atlanta, and some even believe that the Egyptians traveled west and founded the Union of California. Among these theories, one has recently risen to prominence due to our blending efforts with the Jewish faith. Some believe that the Egyptians actually traveled north and founded the original nation of New Canaan. While spreading this theory would likely aid in our blending efforts, embracing it would undoubtedly deal a blow to our administration’s religious authority."
 zahran_events.16.a: "The Divine Truth"
 zahran_events.16.b: "An Interesting Theory"
 zahran_events.17.t: "Amuntopia"
 zahran_events.17.d: "Blending together the religions of Zahra and Collectivism is extremely difficult due to their vast differences in belief. While most other religions accessible on the American continent share the presence of divine deities, Collectivism simply has a number of patron saints who define its belief. Yet, there is one aspect of Collectivism which is ever present and acts as a deity of sorts: Utopia. Branding Utopia as a state outside of Amun’s glory would greatly benefit our efforts to blend Collectivism and Zahra. However, this would come at the great price of production amongst our citizenry as they struggle to find a reason to work."
 zahran_events.17.a: "Uhhhh, sure"
 zahran_events.17.b: "None of this makes sense"
 zahran_events.18.t: "Marx was Egyptian"
 zahran_events.18.d: "Before the Nileans, there were the Egyptians. Living along the great river, the Egyptians built a mighty civilization before leaving to find their land of origin in the east. Theories about the fate of the Egyptians are widespread and diverse among the members of the Zahra faith. Among some of the most fringe groups, there is a belief that the Egyptians actually sailed west and up the Californian coast to found the Collectivist nations of Rusland. Of course, this is seen as a ridiculous notion to most in our nation, but if we were to espouse its authenticity it could assist in our blending of the Zahra and Collectivist faiths."
 zahran_events.18.a: "Of course!"
 zahran_events.18.b: "NO, I refuse"
 zahran_events.19.t: "Primitive Amun"
 zahran_events.19.d: "Amun has a second, more ancient title which is frequently used by Zahran imams and pharos: Allgod. Originating from the ancient deity Allahgod, who was worshiped by some of the Egyptians, Allgod represents a single deity which contains aspects of all other deities. Instead of outright denying the existence of the kami or Christian god, the Zahra instead relied upon merging all of them into a single unified image. Originally, the Allgod was seen as an ancient and uncaring deity who did not meddle in the affairs of the world. This version of the Allgod has emerged among the more primitive members of our populace as we attempt to blend our two faiths. While this is certainly useful for our current blending efforts, its continued worship could lead to a bastardized and heretical practice."
 zahran_events.19.a: "He was always with them"
 zahran_events.19.b: "Not our Amun"
 zahran_events.20.t: "Ma'at Minded Natives"
 zahran_events.20.d: "Followers of Zahra can always rely on the natural balance of the world to ensure harmony. At the height of the Floridian slave trade, Zahran imams often led plots against their masters and were successful in restoring a balance of power. When subjugated by the Reiwas in ancient times, the Floridians weathered their brutal treatment with the hope that balance may be restored one day. We now face troubles in this new world where hunger, disease, and threats from all corners threaten to destroy all that we have built. In times such as these, we should fall back on our roots and educate those around us on the hope that balance brings."
 zahran_events.20.a: "Togther, we will thrive."
 zahran_events.21.t: "Isfet"
 zahran_events.21.d: "The opposite of Ma’at is Isfet, representing injustice and chaos. Among the first Zahra societies, Isfet was personified in a being opposite to Amun known as Iblis. Slowly, over time, Isfet came to be known as an unnatural force rather than a malevolent deity. Either through blending different religions with Zahra or poor decisions, our society has fallen into an imbalance. We must now choose who will take on the burden of this Isfet. We could sacrifice our administration’s stability or force our subjects to take on the burden. Whatever the choice, we must work towards restoring balance before it's too late."
 zahran_events.21.a: "We will take the blow"
 zahran_events.21.b: "Our people will make do"
 zahran_events.22.t: "Demanding Cohesion"
 zahran_events.22.d: "Through either blending Zahra with other religions or poor decisions, our society has collapsed to a chaotic state. We must work to restore Ma’at, so that the proper balance of the world can be ensured. There are many ways in which to do this, nearly every one of them requiring significant effort from our own administration. In order to ease this burden we could exploit the resources of the rich community of [province_to_spawn_rebels.GetName]. Using their resources, the task of restoring balance would become much easier. The people of [province_to_spawn_rebels.GetName] would no doubt resist this attempt to seize their local development, but in the long run it might be more beneficial for our nation to take this step. We must consider the consequences and potential rewards of such a choice carefully before moving forward."
 zahran_events.22.a: "Sacrifices must be made"
 zahran_events.22.b: "We will recover"
 zahran_events.23.t: "Liars Abound"
 zahran_events.23.d: "Our society is in a difficult position. Either through attempting to blend different religions with Zahra or poor decisions on our part we have forever tarnished our society with injustice and chaos. The streets of our great cities are mired with all kinds of thieves and scoundrels. This is reflected in our palace halls, as members of our innermost circles take bribes and rob the common people. Such corruption cannot last, we must do something in order to restore balance to our state. One day, Ma’at will return again. Until then, we must be diligent and proactive to combat this widespread corruption that plagues our administration."
 zahran_events.23.a: "Troubling..."
 zahran_events.24.t: "A Just World"
 zahran_events.24.d: "Ma’at forms the backbone of Zahran society. Centuries ago, before the time of the Egyptians, the world was beset by chaos and injustice. There was no one to preserve Amun’s great laws and, for this, society suffered. With the rise of the Egyptians and their reintroduction of Amun’s word, the world was once again graced with the beauty of balance. We have embraced these words and etched them into the very fabric of our society. With our mastery of Ma’at, we have crafted a perfectly just world which we may bend to our will. Our society is fluid, changing its stability with the lightest touch. We could exploit this current state of pliability or simply bask in the glory of our balance."
 zahran_events.24.a: "Grace from Amun!"
 zahran_events.24.b: "We stay just"
 zahran_events.25.t: "Authoritative Balance"
 zahran_events.25.d: "While Ma’at brings our society many benefits, too much of it can bring about absolute equality. It is written within the Qur’an that true Zahra entails the pursuit of an equal society among perfect people. Our nation has managed to achieve much of the former, with an abundance of Ma’at, yet we are no closer to the latter. Not a single citizen of our nation is perfect, which has led to an discrepency in the very fabric of the Zahra faith. With our glut of Ma’at, we have created an unequal equal society. This dissonance has expressed itself in skepticism towards our administration as our people wonder why we must stay in charge if we are truly all equal. Sadly, there is nothing we can do to remedy this other than wait for Amun to make us pure."
 zahran_events.25.a: "Such is the nature of equality"
 zahran_events.26.t: "A Harmonious Resistance"
 zahran_events.26.d: "The balance and justice which Ma’at brings shows its greatest benefits during times of war. While our enemy stumbles over their chaotic ranks, our forces will stay disciplined and ready to achieve victory. Beyond the act of battle, during times of war our balanced society is much more able and willing to provide support. We can always use more resources on the front lines, so let us exploit this willingness to gain a better fighting force, recruit more soldiers, or educate the next generation in martial matters. However, it is important to remember that balance must be maintained at all costs. If we already have enough of any of these resources, we can sacrifice our current stockpile to get closer to complete balance."
 zahran_events.26.a: "We balance our attack"
 zahran_events.26.b: "We balance our recruitment"
 zahran_events.26.c: "We balance our talent"
 zahran_events.27.t: "Lacking Direction"
 zahran_events.27.d: "Our nation currently finds itself at a pivotal spiritual crosspoint. Ma’at represents balance and justice to the Zahrans. This balance guides the basic processes of life and course of history. Having a society that is rich in Ma’at is profoundly useful, yet disrupting the balance is often necessary to complete spiritual actions. We must now decide which direction to take our nation. Shall we go forward towards a more balanced society, solidify the faith through blending, or even centralize our rule? Whatever the choice, let us ensure that it is made to best serve Amun and the spiritual needs of our people."
 zahran_events.27.a: "We need a universal faith!"
 zahran_events.27.b: "We need greater Ma'at"
 zahran_events.27.c: "We need a better rule!"
 zahran_events.28.t: "Undecided Masses"
 zahran_events.28.d: "Among the members of our nation there is an indecision which is crushing spiritual progress. Ma’at, the Zahran concept of balance and justice, guides the course of history and the success of peoples. Bringing about a perfect balance requires both the work of the monarch and their citizens, yet our citizens are without direction. To remedy this indecision, we should draft a speech and direct our populace towards either furthering equality or devotion to our administration. Going for the former would greatly increase our administration’s sway at the cost of our Ma’at, while the latter would sacrifice our influence for balance."
 zahran_events.28.a: "Move towards devotion"
 zahran_events.28.b: "Move towards equality"
 zahran_events.29.t: "Nagging Questions"
 zahran_events.29.d: "Chaos has beset our nation after an outspoken imam has challenged the very fundamentals of the Zahra faith. Ma’at, the concept of balance and justice in Zahra, is said to guide the course of history and influence the prosperity of all peoples. A troubling imam has stated that Ma’at is to be avoided, that toal balance will bring complacency and a lack of prosperity. Instead, the imam claims that true Ma’at will only be achieved once all are made pure by Amun. Of course, such heretical and false thoughts should have been easy to reject, yet our administration has found it hard to find flaws in their reasoning. Some of our closest advisors have even suggested that we bring this imam into our court in order to diversify the administration’s opinion. Others have suggested that we have the imam put to death. Whatever our choice, we must respond to these claims soon or face complete chaos."
 zahran_events.29.a: "Refute their claims"
 zahran_events.29.b: "Bring them into our court"
 zahran_events.29.c: "Have them put to death!"
 zahran_events.30.t: "The Middleground"
 zahran_events.30.d: "The current state of our nation enforces a policy of inaction. This middleground is not to be confused with Ma’at, the Zahran concept of balance and justice. Rather than keeping a balanced nation, we have simply let the world decide how our nation ought to be. This has led to a so-so state of affairs, but this is not the way which it needs to stay. Through stepping in and nudging our state in a solid direction we can impact our stability and balance. Of course, doing anything is more difficult than doing nothing. Perhaps it would be for the best if we continued to follow down the road of inaction."
 zahran_events.30.a: "Stability before Balance"
 zahran_events.30.b: "Balance before Stability"
 zahran_events.30.c: "We remain neutral"
 zahran_events.31.t: "Court Gators"
 zahran_events.31.d: "Zahra holds the spiritual importance of certain animals. Among these are the gators, monstrously large beasts native to Florida and Cuba. The hide of the gator is valued among the rich nobility of the islands for its rich texture and rare nature. The meat of the gator is seen as sacred among the Zahrans and is rarely eaten before important events. Live gators are seen as representations of the Floridian people and the Zahran faith due to their formidable strength and strange build. It is for this reason that some in our administration have suggested that we bring gators into the palace. This practice is not wholly unusual among the Zahran elite, with many ancient rulers hosting gators in their own courts as symbols of power and status. Yet, some among our administration fear that these beasts may break free and attack the soft bureaucrats. The only question remains is if that is a bad thing."
 zahran_events.31.a: "What could go wrong?"
 zahran_events.31.b: "Very dangerous"
 zahran_events.32.t: "Gator Accident"
 zahran_events.32.d: "The palace at [Root.Capital.GetName] has erupted into chaos as one of our court gators has broken free. In its romp around the castle, the gator brutally attacked and slaughtered one of our closest advisors. Once the beast is tamed and the panic subsides, we will be faced with the difficult decision of what to do with the rest of the gators. Of course, their presence in the court is what caused such an incident. Yet, we have come to respect the gentle giants and even formed a sort of bond. If we were to part with our gator buddies, they would undoubtedly be slaughtered for their hide and meat. Perhaps it is best to let them continue to live in the court and chalk this incident up to a simple accident."
 zahran_events.32.a: "Just an accident"
 zahran_events.32.b: "Get rid of them!"
 zahran_events.33.t: "A Terrible Fate"
 zahran_events.33.d: "The worst has come to pass. On a routine stroll through the palace, when passing by the court gators, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was attacked and pinned down by one of the foul beasts. With [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arm trapped between the gator’s jaws, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could only flail as the teeth sunk in. In a quick move, the gator began to rapidly roll, twisting the arm free from its joint and ripping the skin apart like dough. Struggling to get free [Root.Monarch.GetName], only positioned [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] further under the gator’s body as it crashed onto [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head. In just an instant, the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was crushed under the gator. The lifeless corpse was wrung like a doll as the gator finally separated the arm and guzzled it down its throat. Such a gruesome incident should serve as a reminder to the rest of the Zahran world as to the dangers of holding gators close. Our nation will mourne and recover in time."
 zahran_events.33.a: "Horror!"
 zahran_events.34.t: "Sihr"
 zahran_events.34.d: "There is no exact rigid practice of the Zahran faith. Most of the faithful derive their practice from those that the Egyptians are described to have done in the Qur’an. This has led to a disparity in belief and some contention between different sects. One of the most hotly debated topics among the Zahran faith is the practice of Sihr, or folk magic. Among the early Egyptians, it was said that some were able to make their crops grow juicer and fuller through purifying their water. Some believe that this indicates that faithful followers of the faith can do things only thought to be possible by Amun. Among members of our populace, there has been growing support for spreading the practice of Sihr. Whether we think the practice is heretical or not should guide if we decide to let it continue or shut it down."

 zahran_events.35.d: "After we allowed our populace to practice Sihr, our own [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] began to dabble in the magic. Though not successful in many ways, the process deepened [Root.Monarch.GetName] ‘s appreciation for the Zahran faith. This had not gone unnoticed, as a discrete letter was slipped into [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s hands during a regular day at the palace. It was an invitation to join the most secretive society in all of Florida: The Magic Kingdom. For centuries from the city of Orlando, the magical elite of Zahran society have guided the flow of the island’s civilization. Leading the revolt against the Kyushans, protecting Floridians from the slave trade, and enforcing Shinto tolerance were all part of the group’s master plan. As a new member of the society, our nation will be supported by their covert means. With these powerful elites at our back, our reign shall never be questioned."

 zahran_events.36.t: "Books Galore"
 zahran_events.36.d: "Throughout the Zahran world, there is little consensus on what constitutes the “right” practice of the faith. Nowhere is this clearer than in the different books which the Zahran faithful use to define their worship. For some, the Qur’an is used. Different from the Islamic Quran, the Qur’an recounts the Egyptians’ dissapearance, Amun’s purification, and the rise of the Nileans. From the tales of the Qur’an, many Zahrans derive their path to worship by mirroring the holy practices of the characters. Some of the Zahran faithful use the Floridian Bible, a book which recounts much of the same tales of the Egyptians and Nileans, but also features the story of Jesus. As the religious guide for our people, it is our responsibility to decide which of the books they should derive their faith from."

 zahran_events.37.t: "Finding the Egyptians"
 zahran_events.37.d: "Before the Nileans, there were the Egyptians. Living along the Nile, the Egyptians forged a mighty civilization. Yet, the Egyptians believed that Florida was not their true home. Instead, they believed that their home was beyond the sea. Depending on one’s own particular beliefs, the ultimate fate of the Egyptians is radically different. Some believe that they sailed west and founded the union of California. Others believe they only went north and settled on the island of Georgia. Others believe they went east, and settled across the waves. Of course, with our own efforts to settle the new world we have found many groups that may have descended from these Egyptians. We must investigate this matter further and determine whether or not the Egyptians are truly gone."
 zahran_events.37.a: "We will find them!"
 zahran_events.38.t: "Pyramid Incidents"
 zahran_events.38.d: "Shinto has its shrines, Christianity has its churches, and we have pyramids. Built by the Egyptians during ancient times, pyramids serve as places for Zahran faithful to gather and worship. Each pyramid is led by an Imam, who maintains its structure and provides guidance for those that are struggling with their faith. For this reason, Imams must be well chosen and fervent in their belief. The dangers of a lackluster imam have shown themselves in [pyramid_incident_zahran.GetName], where a ruined pyramid collapsed onto some of its worshipers. This incident has sparked a national outrage at the imam and many have called upon our administration to do something. Typically, we stay out of local matters such as these, but the outcry may force our hand. Some in our administration have suggested that we use our own resources to repair the pyramid, while others have suggested that we simply enlist a new imam to fix the issue."

 zahran_events.38.b: "We will repair it ourselves"
 zahran_events.38.c: "They will figure it out"
 zahran_events.39.t: "Sweets of the Pharohs"
 zahran_events.39.d: "Sugar has defined the history of the Zahran faith. In the early days of the Japanese empire, the Reiwa dynasty referred to the faith as “Sugar-Shinto” due to the faith of the sugar merchants. The Americans simply referred to the Zahrans as Sweetfolk. Peter continued this tradition among the Ecclesials and spread the name throughout the Great Lakes. Ironically enough, it wasn’t until the height of the Floridian Slave trade that the name Zahra caught on, meaning flower in the native Floridian tongue. Now, we continue this rich legacy of sugar growing in our own province of [sweets_of_the_pharoh_prov.GetName]. The rich harvest of this season has provided our administration with a pleasant opportunity to spread some goodwill. We could either reinvest the funds from its sale into developing [sweets_of_the_pharoh_prov.GetName] or spread the wealth among the people."

 zahran_events.40.d: "There have been few times in which the grand island of Florida was united. The homeplace of the Zahrans, Florida is fabled to be the place in which Amun will return and purify the entire world. Through significant effort, we have united the island under our reign. As the great pharaoh of these lands, we have ascended to a special religious status above all previous rulers. We can commune with the great Amun himself and execute his will. Let us give thanks to the Allgod for his glory and continue our worship so that we might hold this status into the next life."
