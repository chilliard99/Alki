Instead of annexation through diplomacy they can only be united through decision."

The hierarchical structure places the Emperor of Canada at the top. His rule is divinely ordained and justified through the people's acceptance. Below him is the royal family which includes his direct blood. From there there is ‘The Mounties’, the elite generals who guide The Canadian Army to victory in combat. Below them are the bureaucrats, local rulers who often work in tandem to create change within a region. These different bodies enact change and allow for the management of the monumentally large state."

 PRIMITIVE_TRIBUTARY:1 "Too Primitive to Make a Tributary"
 LADEDADDEORO:1 "La Edad De Oro"
 LADEDADDEORO_DESC:1 "The lands at the heart of Mexico serve as the domain of his eminence and center of the Mexican civilization. In the wake of failed crusades and collapsing kingdoms, the golden age of Mexico is coming to a close. The Kingdom of Oaxaca’s recent victory at the battle of Veracruz has shaken up the balance of power in an unprecedented way, leaving the rest of Anahuac to pick up the pieces. The companies of Empresia have begun to centralize, wanting to remain competative in a greatly expanding world. Meanwhile, the slow disintegration of the Mayan state in the Yucatan has left a power vacuum in the south. As these tensions continue to grow, the Pope’s power slowly wanes and the fear of religious schism spreads throughout the continent."
 THEMORNINGAFTER:1 "The Morning After"
 THEMORNINGAFTER_DESC:1 "After centuries of crusading, the lands of Africa have calmed into relative peace. As a new age dawns, the kingdoms have found that the process of ruling is much more difficult than conquest. The Great Empire of Texas now battles against its own century-long decline due to plagues, heretics, and poor bureaucracy. As the largest empire on the Mexican continent begins to buckle, their eager neighbors of Arizonia and Rio Grande hungrily look towards usurping its position. With a glut of wealth flowing in from the gulf, professional armies trained on years of crusading, and incompetent kings at the helm, any conflict is sure to be costly and deadly."
 EASTERNISLES:1 "Eastern Isles"
 EASTERNISLES_DESC:1 "To the far east, the Japanese Isles sit proud beyond the continent’s petty struggles. The far island of Florida has broken free from Canadian domination and, with the proclamation of 1409, has emancipated itself from the brutal institution of slavery. The last remnants of the great Kyushu empire now begin to foster new identities on the southern isle. In the north, the dying shogun still holds control over a collection of daimyos and is poised to reclaim the glory of the Reiwan dynasty. On the isle of Hokkaido, the ancient Kakizaki dynasty is attempting to piece together what they have left after their losses in the Saint Lawrence Gulf. Throughout all of this, the looming threat of a Canadian invasion is ever present as the empire turns its eyes to the east."
 THEBITTERKING:1 "The Bitter King"
 THEBITTERKING_DESC:1 "The Canadian Empire dominates the lands east of the Mississippi, with only pockets of resistance standing against the expanding dominion. After Antebella and Ohio’s disastrous defeat at the hands of the emperor Fredrick Lafayette, the Maple Throne’s suzerainty over New Canaan and Wisconsin was assured. As the emperor sours in his old age, there are whispers amongst the faithful of Michigan that the fated heir might retake the throne. In the south, the great Sultan of Columbus now turns his eyes to the east in an attempt to consolidate territory and build strength. Through it all, Frederick’s tributaries lie in wait for an opportunity at freedom."
 THEGREATPLAINS:1 "The Great Plains"
 THEGREATPLAINS_DESC:1 "The many tribes of the Great Plains have asserted themselves as a new force within the American continent. Venturing south from the collapsing Metis empire, these Plainwalkers made their home on the sparsely settled steppe. Those that stood in the way were quickly assimilated or pushed out, but some still are still fighting for resistance. The ancient kingdoms of Occitania and Italia can trace their lineage back to the days of the American Empire, but are now falling to their cunning northern neighbors. With the recent defeat of the Dakota coalition by the Sioux and consolidation of Roosevelt by the Crow, the plains are heating up for an all out brawl."
 REALMOFTHEPROPHET:1 "Realm Of The Prophet"
 REALMOFTHEPROPHET_DESC:1 "Most of the religions on the American continent can trace their lineage back to one man: Jesus of The Salt Lake. The lands from which he took his name are bountiful with resources and mighty states. In the far west lies the Union of California, an ancient and complex society based on ancient democratic ideals. The people of the Union are diverse, from Plainwalker Oregonites in the north to Baja Africans in the south. With the kingdom of Utah pushing further into Nevada and the Alaskan Union conquering south, the age of California may soon come to an end."
 SOLIDARITYANDTHESTEPPE:1 "Solidarity On The Steppe"
 SOLIDARITYANDTHESTEPPE_DESC:1 "Far north, in the cold plains of Ursalia, the ancient Collectivists and Moond reside in a newly changing world.  The Metis descended bands of Kiikiwaahk bicker amongst themselves in an attempt to reform the great empire. Beyond the Rockies, the collectivist Alaskan Union recently united the disparate communes of the Cascadian Coast into a formidable united front against the southern Partisan threat. As the union continues to assert its control over Washington, conflict with the Californians only becomes more inevitable."
 TURMOILINTHETROPICS:1 "Turmoil In The Tropics"
 TURMOILINTHETROPICS_DESC:1 "The lush green tropics are home to the people of Isthmo and the Caribbean. Similar to the Yucatan, the collapse of the Colombian Empire has left Isthmo in a state of decline with many local lords attempting to hold onto their realms. In the Caribbean, the great kingdom of Cuba continues its nearly two century long peace under Catholic rule. During this unprecedented period, many noble families have begun funding exploration into the antilles with the hope that a solid settlement could better direct Brazilian trade. Whispers have even begun of a far off continent, beyond the windward and leeward isles, whose shores are ripe for conquest."
 SOUTHERNFRONTIER:1 "Southern Frontier"
 SOUTHERNFRONTIER_DESC:1 "Beyond the grip of the Pope, the realms of Colombia and Malaysia feature their own advanced civilizations. The recent collapse of Gran Colombia has left the region shattered amongst disparate local lords and an unprotected Espiritismo frontier. Conversely, the recent unification of the heavenly Tawantinsuyu kingdom under Tupac IV has revived a centuries old Incan tradition. The eternal Brazilian empire continues its slow expansion into the surrounding isles while remaining the center of Malaysian trade. As the Caribbean and Canadian powers begin their colonial empires, turmoil is sure to taint the calm waters."
 THENEWWORLD:1 "The New World"
 THENEWWORLD_DESC:1 "Prior to the arrival of the Americans, the new world is brimming with life. In the far east, the Chinese cliques hold a thriving civilization. The German Bundeslands of Yoroppa continue their conquest and expansion into the surrounding tribes. The tribes of Endea, Pablonia, and Fayettia are all poised to establish grand civilizations of their own. Whatever misfortune those from across the sea bring, the lands of the New World must ready themselves in kind."
 string_start_japanese_isles: "Far east of the American continent lies the serene §YJapanese§! archipelago. The isles, once united under the mighty §YReiwa§! dynasty in centuries past, are divided among a number of dukes, kings, and shoguns. As the Japanese begin exploring new trade routes in the south, lucrative opportunities are sure to appear beyond the waves.\n\nThe Shogun of §YTokyo’s§! once mighty grasp on the island of Honshu has mostly collapsed. All that remains are a series of disloyal daimyos known as §YThe Southern Cities§!. With hostile powers surrounding the small states, unity is necessary in order to prevent total destruction.\n\nThe once mighty §YAinu Kingdom§! of the north has lost much of what it once held. The lands of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Maine are a distant memory to the rulers of the current state. Now the hungry eyes of the Ainu Kingdom turn south to the lands of §YTohoku§! and §YNippon§! as they attempt to pick up the pieces of what remains.\n\nOn the isle of §YKyushu§!, the remnants of the imperial roads and palaces serve as a reminder of the great empire which inhabited these lands. The powerful duchy of §YFukuoka§! has started its campaign to unite the isle by dominating the north and monopolizing the §Yporcelain§! industry.\n\nThe isle of §YFlorida§! continues to prosper in its independence. Ever since the §YProclamation of 1409§!, the end of Kyushan occupation of the island, and the Cajun retreat: Florida is at peace. However, no peace lasts forever and the Kingdom of §YCairo§! has begun exerting its influence over the Nilean people. In turn, the Kingdom of §YCalusa§! has begun clawing back territory taken from it during the §YMagical Revolts§!."
 string_start_great_lakes: "The eastern half of the American continent has been plagued by war for a century with the mighty §YEmpire of Canada§! becoming the eventual victor. The Maple Emperor, §YFredrick Lafayete§!, forged a network of tributaries that stretched from Duluth to Augusta. In his old age, Frederick has soured and grown complacent with his empire’s glory. As tributaries grow restless and fears of insurrection mount, blood is sure to spill into the lakes once again.\n\nIn the south, the newly united tribes of §YOhio§! are now hungry for expansion and security. After their recent defeat in §YFredrick’s War§!, many Buckeyes have come to view their domination over §YAntebella§! and §YHellas§! as necessary for survival. As the new sultan §YUsman II§! begins his rule, the restless bureaucracy established by his father plots his eventual demise.\n\nThe kingdom of §YWisconsin§! has been dominated for the better part of a century by the Lafayettes and now cries for freedom. After the brutal eastern campaign of Fredrick’s War, the former beautiful cities of §YKenosha§! and §YMadison§! were reduced to ash. Revenge for this injustice rings throughout the hearts of Sconnies along Lake Michigan and beyond.\n\nTo the east, the lands of §YNew Canaan§! are in a period of transition. In the north, the rebellious lands of §YEngland§! have been kingless for almost a decade due to Canadian incompetence. In the §YUpstate§!, the rich Laurentian trading kingdoms have been crippled by heavy Canadian tributes. Further south, the collapsing kingdom of the §YLevant§! has let piracy dominate the east coast.\n\nOn the isle of §YMichigan§!, the biggest threat to Canadian suzerainty looms large. The fated heir to the Canadian throne, §YJaxon Lafayette§!, was exiled decades ago for converting to Islam. As Fredrick grows older in age, there are whispers that Jaxon or his son might attempt to reclaim their rightful place on the Canadian throne."

For centuries, the old kingdoms of the west peacefully slumbered until they suffered a rude awakening at the hands of the §YMexican Crusades§!. Massive defeats at §YGrand Junction§! and §YNew Eden§! humiliated the haughty and ineffective kings of yore. By the middle of the 15th century, the new kingdoms which emerged from the crusading ashes have started to assert themselves on the world stage.\n\nThe Kingdom of §YUtah§! prides itself as a direct descendant of the old §YEmpire of America§!. According to Sacramental recountings, it is within the waters of Utah’s very own §YGreat Salt Lake§! that §YJesus Christ§! emerged for the third time. During the §YCrusade for Provence§!, the armies of §YTexas and Monroe§! devastated the Utahn forces and forced the Kingdom to relinquish their holdings in Mexico. Recently, the Kingdom has expanded in all directions in order consolidate their power and prevent another disastrous defeat.\n\nIn the far west, the peculiar §YUnion of California§! continues their legacy of democracy. The Union was formalized into its current state by the disciple §YSamson§!, whose descendants held the role of President and leader of the Union. For nearly a millennium, the Union remained in peace under the §YPresident of Francisco§!, but that all changed with §YLewis “The Elder.”§! During the §Y“War of The Mad,”§! the union was thrown into disorder as their president proclaimed himself the “Supreme Emperor of The Universe” and started torching villages. The nearby states of §YUtah§!, §YArizonia§!, and §YAlaska§! took advantage of this chaos, carving up pieces of the Union for themselves. As the 15th century nears its middle, the Union is still recovering from their century of chaos.\n\nIn the east, the §YKingdoms of Occitania§! and §YItalia§! are in periods of change. During the crusade for the holy city of §YEden§!, the Catholics established a large presence on the Italian peninsula. However, the fickle Italians quickly revolted against the occupying force and reclaimed their region. Now the last remains of the Catholic §YPeconite Order§! hold out in the south, struggling to maintain their autonomy. While the Italian state was growing, their Occitanian neighbors were on the decline. With the arrival of the §YPlainwalkers§! and several defeats from the Utahns, the last remaining French state is on the brink of extinction.\n\nTo the north, the §YUnion of Alaska§! has recently risen to prominence. A §YCollectivist§! nation, Alaska does not worry itself with the silly religious conflicts within the Sacramental faith, instead focusing on ushering in the §YUtopia§!. Through a series of treaties, the §YCommune of Anchorage§! united the disparate communes of §YArborea§! and §YAlaska§! into a single large union. With the promise of opportunities across the waves, the future is growing bright for the new state."
 string_start_plainwalkers: "Centuries ago, the §YGreat Metis Empire§! collapsed in a blur of revolution, famine, and disease. In its absence, the lands of §YKiikiwaahk§! descended into chaos and war. Quickly, many tribal bands fled the disorder into the open southern plains. These bands brutally conquered new territories and adopted the identity of the former tribes. They were eventually granted a new title: §YPlainwalkers§!. As these states continue to grow in strength, it's unclear what role they will serve in the American tapestry.\n\nIn the lands of §YDakota§!, the successful §YSioux§! have asserted themselves as the most powerful Plainwalker Kingdom. In an attempt to stop their meteoric rise, a series of Dakota dukes formed a large coalition against the state, but were swiftly defeated by the legendary prince §YHanska Capa§!. As the aging king §YHotah§! starts to fall ill, eyes turn to the prince to live up to his reputation.\n\nThe §YCrow Confederacy§! has emerged quickly as a counter balance to the rising Sioux threat. Through the use of new §Yblackpowder§! technology from the §YBajio§!, the master Crow tactician §YYellowtail§! managed to siege down some of the most resistant cities of the plains. The Confederacy now stands tall with a new mission, to reconquer the lands of their ancestors in Kiikiwaahk. This dogmatic §Y“Ozuye”§! has begun to inspire their neighbors and will no doubt spell trouble for the bands of the north.\n\nIn the lands of §YIdaho§!, tensions are high between the §YShoshone§! and their southern neighbors. As one of the most sophisticated Plainwalker kingdoms, the Shoshone have come to be feared throughout Utah and the Californian Union. At the dawn of the 15th century, the king of Utah drafted a deal to prevent future bloodshed between the two nations by dividing the border in the north. However, as the generations pass this deal grows distant in memory. With a glory-hungry Utah on the rise, the kingdoms of Idaho must prepare for anything.\n\nThe ancient lands of §YKiikiwaahk§! are a shadow of their former self. In the days of yore, their power once rivaled the §YAmerican Empire§! in the south. By the 15th century, the plains of §YAlberta§! and §YSaskachetwan§! lie bitterly divided amongst a series of different bands, more interested in fairing goods from §YCanada§! to §YCalifornia§! than reclaiming their legacy. With rising powers surrounding their borders, it's no doubt these bands will have to stick together or face subjugation."
 string_start_mexican: "By the middle of the 15th century, the §YMexican continent§! had experienced five centuries of prosperity. From repelling patriotic hordes to retaking the holy city of §YRome§!, the §YPope of Tepeyac§! had a hand in most of it. The §YCatholic§! faith claims to trace its origins back to a mysterious time before the §YSacramentals§! and even §Ythe flood§!. They espouse that this ancient legitimacy has allowed them to flourish throughout these centuries, but dark clouds are beginning to grow on the horizon. As the §YTexan Empire§! continues its decline and the §YOaxacans§! approach Mexico city, the Pope’s infallibility has been brought into question. The hushed whispers of a possible §Yschism§! have occupied the thoughts of Catholic monarchs as they grow uneasy for what the coming centuries may hold.\n\n§YThe Texan Empire§! in the north, grown fat off of multiple conquests and papal favoritism, has found that the process of ruling is much more difficult than conquest. The redistribution of land to former §Ycrusaders§! has put vast swaths of territory outside of the Emperor’s reach. Combine this with a disloyal military and it's no wonder the neighboring nations of §YArizonia§! and §YRio Grande§! are readying themselves for an intervention. In order to survive the coming years, the sickly emperor §YAntonio§! will need to act decisively.\n\nIn the south, the brutally efficient §YOaxacan Kingdom§! has inserted itself as the preeminent power in §YAnahuac§!. Through suppressing individual tribal identities and adopting the most successful practices of their neighbors, the Oaxacans have come to defeat some of the most powerful Mexican kingdoms. Most recently they managed to capture the heartland of gulf trade: §YVeracruz§!. Now with the most powerful economic engine on the continent and a hungry military, the Oaxacans are ready to expand in all directions.\n\nTo the east of the mainland’s struggles, the §YSerene Kingdom of Cuba§! continues its years of peace. Coming from an ancient tradition of civilization, the kingdom has routinely been the strongest power in the §YCaribbean§!. Recently, the kingdom adopted the Catholic faith which led to conflict against its §YEspiritismo§! neighbors. With opportunities presenting themselves across the waves, the lucrative spice trade flowing in from the east, and pirates abound in the sea, the Kings of Cuba will need to act fruitfully in the coming centuries in order to maintain their status."
 string_start_colombian_and_malaysian: "Civilization beyond the continents of §YAmerica§! and §YMexico§! presents itself in strange ways. The lands of §YColombia§! and the §YAndes§! were traditionally shattered among different §YEspiritismo§! warlords until the arrival of the §YMexican crusaders§!. Through a series of bloody conflicts, the Columbian world was successfully Christianized and united into one empire. By the middle of the 15th century, infighting and revolution collapsed §YGran Colombia§! and returned it to its divided state. With the blood-thirsty princes of the land eager to claim the §Yemerald crown§!, it's only a matter of time before the region bursts into all out war.\n\nThe Colombian Empire crashed in a blaze of glory after a century of hegemony. The §YValladolid§! dynasty which united the land was crippled by attempts to democratize the nation. The upstart son §YSamuel III§! joined with a broad coalition of Colombian natives, Mexican crusaders, and Venezuelans in order to create a §Yparliament§!. However, when the king heard news of this development, he sent for his own son’s execution and began a bloody civil war. The aftermath of this civil war is the bitterly divided nature of Colombia’s current situation. Local dukes and former warlords slinked away from the rule at §YBogota§! in order to avoid losing their authority or becoming involved in the growing quagmire.\n\nTo the south, the world of the Andes is continuing its rich tradition of commerce and enginuity. Despite the many attempts of Colombian missionaries, the region has held onto its unique dualistic faith of §YYanatin§!. While this faith sets apart the region in the Columbian theatre, it also isolates it from potential allies. It is under this pretense that the rising §YTawantinsuyu§! state has come to expand in its new environment. The powerful §YSapa Inca Tupac IV§! earns his legitimacy from the mythical incan empire of old, which at one point held lands across the whole of Colombia and the Andes.\n\nIn the remote corners of the known world, the great §YEmpire of Brazil§! rules the waves. For centuries, this gentle giant has held a monopoly over the lucrative §Yspice trade§! and expanded its influence across the islands of §YMalaysia§!. As the demand for the spice continues to grow and the noble classes of Brazil become more unruly, the emperor will need to find balance among the growing cacophony of power."

 form_africa_desc: "§Y“Nothing Without Providence”§W\n\nWhen Jesus of the Salt Lake lay dying he called his closest disciples to him. With his final breaths he described the role each of them would play within the new American Empire. To Matthew he gave the task of wresting control of Africa and converting them to the faith. Ever since this moment, through changes of faiths and peoples, we have held onto the idea of Africa. It is then our destiny to occupy this land and claim it as our legacy."
 form_antilles_title: "Unite Antilles"
 form_antilles_desc: "§Y“After God, the Earth”§W\n\nThe Caribbean has been united once before, under the Cuban kings of centuries past. When the Japanese Empire abandoned the Bahamas and Hispaniola the vacuum of their absence was filled by the powerful new Antillean empire. If we were to claim the lands they once held, it would only be obvious that we take the same title."
 form_baja_menor_title: "Unite Baja Menor"
 form_baja_menor_desc: "§Y“Good and Lavish”§W\n\nArizonia’s invasion of Baja and further three year occupation saw most of the northern peninsula fall under the weight of the Africa army. However, the south managed to bitterly resist. Despite this, many of the princes were forced to give up their land and swear new oaths of loyalty to the emperor. This mistreatment has tied our brethren together, it is only a matter of time before we become whole."
 form_baja_title: "Unite Baja"
 form_baja_desc: "§Y“Justice Begins Here”§W\n\nBaja was admitted to the empire by a whim of the congress, but long before that it was a mighty empire. Built around its great bay, the Californians colonized all corners of the peninsula. They fished alongside the whales and walked alongside the lizards. The dream of a united Baja is not a futile one, it is the only one worth holding."
 form_bajio_title: "Reform Bajio"
 form_bajio_desc: "§Y“¡Dios lo quiere!”§W\n\nThe great kingdom of Bajio was the sole force which protected all of Mexico from falling to the Patriotic tribes of the north. After the collapse of Matthew’s African empire, the native population clung to their old Patriotic faith and blended it with new elements of the Sacramental story. When these tribes reached the border of the Bajio, they were met with a strong unified kingdom. Throughout those dark years thousands died in protection of the Catholico faith, but in the end the lands endured. Now the realm is shattered amongst disparate kings, it is time we restore these lands to their true glory."
 form_ciboa_title: "Form Cibao"
 form_ciboa_desc: "§Y“Where Wealth Abounds”§W\n\nThe Cibao stands in stark contrast to the rest of the island of Hispaniola as its own distinct culture. The people who inhabit the valley have long held the richest villages and dominated the politics across the waves. The state has united several times, with many seeing the unity of the Cibaon people as the first step to ultimate Hispaniolan unity. Regardless of these past attempts, should we unite our brothers and sisters, it would be the only logical step to claim the title."
 form_coahuila_title: "Unite Coahuila"
 form_coahuila_desc: "§Y“Where The Serpents Creep”§W\n\nAndré de Zaragoza was one of the original capitalistas who founded Empresia, and ever since the companies that inhabit the region have shared his distinctive mannerisms. The men of Zaragoza trust the market to be bullish and carry over this same boldness into combat. The Gaiteros de Zaragoza are some of the most feared military companies throughout Mexico, serving most prominently during the riverside revolt of Rio Grande. If we conquer these lands, a rebrand may be necesarry."
 form_durango_title: "Unite Durango"
 form_durango_desc: "§Y“Beyond the Water”§W\n\nThe grand company of Durango has always been a unique force within Empresia. Ever since the early days in the desert, the company has been focused on marking its own path in the face of its neighbors. The company remains bullish when others begin to cut their losses and bearish when the market is in full swing. Nowhere is this unique attitude better displayed than within the traditional capital of the region: Durango City. Generations of artists have created twisted iron statues which line the skyline. If we conquer these lands, a rebrand may be necesarry."
 form_guadalupe_title: "Form Guadalupe"
 form_guadalupe_desc: "§Y“God Never Dies”§W\n\nThe lands of Anahuac have traditionally been dominated by the influence of the pope, but as time has moved forward his influence wanes. During the height of the church, they controlled lands from Tabasco to Zacatecas in the grand kingdom of Guadalupe. Nowadays this region is shattered, but ripe for the taking. It is our destiny to claim these lands in the name of Our Lady."
 form_guatemala_title: "Form Guatemala"
 form_guatemala_desc: "§Y“Grow Free and Fertile”§W\n\nThe Guatemalan territory has been juggled over for most of its history. Recently it was under the thumb of the Mayans before breaking free. Despite this, the Guatemalans have held protected autonomy in most states they inhabit. This is mostly due to their fierce resistance to rule. The large hills and tight jungles serve as the perfect places to bitterly resist occupying forces. This independence has fostered a unique identity amongst our brethren which we should claim if we were to conquer these lands."
 form_haiti_title: "Unite Haiti"
 form_haiti_desc: "§Y“Union Makes Strength”§W\n\nThe western half of Hispaniola has held radical differences when compared to the east. Its people speak a tongue more similar to that of the Louisians than the Dominicans and carry themselves like Canadians more than Cibaons. Despite this, the Haitians have routinely been under the thumb of the Dominicans and Cibaons. It is about time that we strike out on our own, find our own legacy, and create a state to last generations."
 form_hispaniola_title: "Unite Hispaniola"
 form_hispaniola_desc: "§Y“Mother of All Lands”§W\n\nHispaniola has historically been one of the most advanced regions in the world, highly developed and leading in technology. Its current sad state is a result of repeated natural disasters, rampant piracy, and repeated invasions from Cuba and Puerto Rico. Our brothers and sisters across the land cry out for our unity, who are we to deny them what they request?"
 form_honduras_title: "Unite Honduras"
 form_honduras_desc: "§Y“Free, Sovereign, and Independent”§W\n\nThe kingdom of Honduras has historically rested at the edges of great empires as a buffer state. Most recently it stood between Gran Colombia and the Mayans, only falling alongside the waves of revolution in the 14th century. Our brethren deserve better than to be some empire’s pawn, let us advance the 7 stripe flag!"
 form_isthmo_title: "Reform Isthmo"
 form_isthmo_desc: "§Y“Hail To The Republic”§W\n\nThe tale of the Ismitho republic is a tragic one. During the 8th century a great state arose in these lands which was built by the common man rather than any noble. Every person who wished could sway the course of the state with their vote. In the end, the republic collapsed under foriegn influence and invasion. Its legacy, the dream of a people united, still lives on in the hearts of our neighbors. Should we conquer this land, the symbols of the past would serve us well."
 form_louisiana_title: "Unite Louisiana"
 form_louisiana_desc: "§Y“Union, Justice, Confidence”§W\n\nLouisiana lies at the confluence of two worlds. In its south trade flows up from Mexico and the Caribbean. In its north trade flows east from Californian and down from Canada. This has made the region an intersection of ideas and cultures. Despite all of this, the region has managed to maintain a distinct identity amongst its neighbors, and if we were to unite our brethren it would only be logical for us to claim it."
 form_neomaya_title: "Reform The Mayans"
 form_neomaya_desc: "§Y“Muy Noble, Muy Leal, Maya”§W\n\nThe Mayan empire has fallen into a state of disrepair lately. While the king of Campeche still claims the title, it is obvious that he holds little legitimacy. The roads that facilitate trade throughout the Yucatan and Isthmo hold the etchings of our people alongside the very churches that the faithful gather. Almost every aspect of this land is landen with our touch, it is only logical that we go forth and claim our great legacy."
 form_neomexico_title: "Unite Mexico"
 form_neomexico_desc: "§Y“¡Mexicanos! ¡Vivan los héroes que nos dieron patria! ¡Viva la Independencia Nacional! ¡Viva México!”§W\n\nThe Mexico continent is filled with thousands of different people groups, hundreds of nations, and dozens of religions. Despite all of this, at one point, it is stated that the continent was made whole. In the wake of the crusades and the general unity of the Catholico faith, the idea of a united Mexico is more tangible than ever. Forward march: ¡Viva México!"
 form_santo_domingo_title: "Form Santo Domingo"
 form_santo_domingo_desc: "§Y“God, Homeland, Freedom”§W\n\nThe kingdom of Santo Domingo has been a continuous force for unity on the island of Hispaniola. Under the rule of a king from the city, the island has been united four times. The Dominicans of the south have historically been the ruling class in these resulting states, damaging their reputation with the rest of the island’s peoples. With this in mind, it's clear that we must take after our forefathers and establish hegemony over these lands."
 form_sinaloa_title: "Form Sinaloa"
 form_sinaloa_desc: "§Y“Land Of The 11 Rivers”§W\n\nSinaloa serves as a major source of imports for the companies of Empresia. Goods are shipped from Bajio and Costa Rica straight into the hands of Durangans and Zaragozans. The original company of Sinaloa was valued for this reason, and ever since the region has taken after the mannerisms of their ancestors. The companies that inhabit the region seek peace, going for long term payoffs rather than quick plays. They follow the general wisdom of the market and avoid straying outside of their comfort zone. If we conquer these lands, a rebrand may be necesarry."
 form_tamaulipas_title: "Form Tamaulipas"
 form_tamaulipas_desc: "§Y“To Work For The Motherland Is To Forge Our Destiny”§W\n\nThe original company of Tamaulipas was the most wealthy of the founding members of Empresia. When the Slim line enacted the merger, they quickly made their way to the top and ever since have held domination over the market and trade within Mexico. As of late, the Slims have taken on a different title of Pemexia as they work to regain their lost subsidiaries. Should we unite the lands of Tamaulipas, a rebrand may be necesarry."
 form_yucatan_title: "Form Yucatan"
 form_yucatan_desc: "§Y“The Eden Of Mexico”§W\n\nThe Yucatan peninsula has historically been dominated by the Mayans, but a more inclusive title has become popular as of late. After the collapse of Mayan rule in Guatemala, Tabasco, and Chiapas there was a general movement for unity under a Yucatan identity. As the Oaxacans push east into our lands, it is only necessary that we unite our brethren and claim this title!"
 form_empresia_title: "Form Empresia"
 form_empresia_desc: "§Y“¡Riqueza Y Libertad! ”§W\n\nIn a time before Jesus of the Salt lake, when the Pope was just a lesser Pontiff, five businessmen shook hands in a desert. With that shake the great merger of Empresia occurred. Ever since subsidiaries have broken off and become more independent. It's about time we put our money and manpower to good use, conquer these lands for glory and profit."
 form_colombia_new_title: "Form Colombia"
 form_colombia_new_desc: "§Y“¡Libertad y Orden!”§W\n\nThe empire of Gran Colombia was a richly diverse state born out of the southern crusades. Native Colombians, Venezuelans, and newly settled Mexicans coexisted in a realm of prosperity. Under the hegemony of the Valladolid dynasty the arts, sciences, and economy flourished. With the region now in such a sad state, it is our burden to go forth and claim the emerald crown: ¡Por Libertad y Orden!"
 form_venezuela_new_title: "Form Venezuela"
 form_venezuela_new_desc: "§Y“Glory To The Brave People”§W\n\nThe Venezuelans were amongst the most resistant to the invasion of Mexican crusaders from the north. Slowly over time, the native Venezuelans either opted to retreat eastward or convert to the faith. In modern times, the Venezuelans lie scattered amongst different religions and cultures. It is up to us to fully realize the vision of a united people. "
 form_ecuador_title: "Form Ecuador"
 form_ecuador_desc: "§Y“Hail, Oh Homeland”§W\n\nEcuador has held a certain cannon as a place of riches within the Mexican mindset. This is mostly due to the fact that Ecuadorian merchants often carried goods from the Andes or Brazil into the Mexican held Colombian lands. If we were to unite our brethren, from Guayaquil to Quito, we might just get closer to making this dream a reality."
 form_victoria_title: "Form Victoria"
 form_victoria_desc: "§Y“For God And Victoria”§W\n\nThe lands of Victoria are the most advanced outside of the American, Colombian, and Mexican continents. The network of intricate trade, bountiful irrigation, and large cities make it unlike anything in Akilineq or Pablonia. For this reason, were we to unite the shattered peoples, it is certain we could put up a hefty resistance to the arriving colonizers."
