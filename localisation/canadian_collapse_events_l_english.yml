 canadian_events.1.t: "The Famine of 1447"
 canadian_events.1.d: "By the 1440s, most of Canada’s populated heartland imported grain from the farther reaches of the empire and its tributary states. Gradually through the centuries, subsistence farming had faded as interconnection between the Canadian tributaries made diversification possible. The glut of grain produced in the Three Cities region and Michigan allowed the Canadian mainland to focus on fur trapping, mining, growing cash crops, and crafting porcelain products. Many influential government officials had warned of a possible food shortage should war break out or harvest fail throughout the tributaries, but their cries had gone mostly unheard by the aging emperor and his lackluster son. Winters throughout the 1440s were especially brutal and further pushed the Canadians to rely on foreign food for their major cities. This delicate house of cards finally collapsed in 1447 as a brutal winter and long rain season hampered crop growth throughout The Three Cities region and Michigan. Raining continued for the next four years, setting crop production severely behind within the Canadian heartland. Thousands fled the cities to the countryside in order to find food. The bulk of corpses within the streets of major cities lent themselves to plague which further destroyed the population. It would take nearly a decade for the empire to fully recover from this disaster."

 canadian_events.2.t: "Cree Betrayl"
 canadian_events.2.d: "The Great Famine has left our country in a state of chaos. While disease ravages the south, the north threatens to break away. The Cree of the north were once united under a mighty Anishinaabe federation before Piece Lafayette’s conquest of their lands. Ever since they have formed an integral part of our empire. However there still remains a large wish for independence among the younger Cree populations, most notably in the former capital of Moosonee. Since the beginning of the famine, a growing sentiment of dissatisfaction has sprung up throughout the Cree world against the ruling Canadian government. A joint delegation of local dukes and governors has traveled to Toronto with a simple proposal: more autonomy. They wish to govern their own lands while the imperial crown gets its faculties back in order. This is a flagrant display of disloyalty on the part of the Cree, but whatever consequences come from rejecting their offer might be more devastating than acceptance."

 canadian_events.3.t: "Hudsonian Crisis"
 canadian_events.3.d: "Three major companies held massive sway within the Canadian economy: The Hudson Company, The Acadian Company, and The Superior Company. Holdovers from before the Lafayettes, these institutions have entrenched themselves within most aspects of trade in the empire. The Hudson Company is the smallest of the three and deals mostly with the northern bay and expansion into The New World. Maintaining the colony of Greenland and exploration beyond is an expensive endeavor for the company, and as of late it has fallen under a large amount of financial duress. The great famine has further worsened their already struggling northern bases, causing many trading posts to be abandoned. The major chairs of the company now approach us to help solve their financial issues through a single lump sum payment and further subsidization for 25 years. In the past, they granted us a large sum during the height of Fredrick’s war which helped us to win the campaign in the east. Returning the favor in these trying times could reinvigorate the economy and further their exploration east. However, we are already struggling to maintain our state through famine and disease. Putting ourselves in debt could prove to be disastrous in the long run."

 canadian_events.4.t: "Death of an Emperor"
 canadian_events.4.d: "Frederick Peterson Pierceson Lafayete, warden of Peterdom, protector of Canada, conqueror of Canaan and Wisconsin, magnanimous judge of the five courts, learned scholar of the classical school, and grand chieftain has finally collapsed in old age. His rule marked the triumphant rise of the Canadian empire over all of The Great Lakes and a period of golden delights. While he might have soured in his old age, among the Canadians there was no one more revered than Fredrick. The same cannot be said for his son Lawrence who has been repeatedly seen as a sickly child by the people of the Canadian state. As he now ascends to the throne, many fear that he will not be able to meet the challenges of ruling the most sophisticated state on the American continent. While these thoughts linger in the hearts of those in Toronto, now is a time for mourning and reflection as a new age dawns."
 canadian_events.4.a: "Our Nation Mourns"
 canadian_events.5.t: "A Jihad in Sudbury"
 canadian_events.5.d: "News has now reached our capital that the great emperor Fredrick Lafayete has finally succumbed to his old age. His son, Lawrence, is very unpopular among the Canadian populace and seen as unfit to rule. Along Lake Huron, the pious North Ontarians have historically held very negative opinions about Lawrence for his lack of acceptance for the Islamic faith. With large populations of the faithful among them, the North Ontarians fear that their religious freedom might be totally lost with this new emperor. In a secret procession to the city of Traverse, the governor of Sudbury has begged $MONARCH$ to travel across the lake and ensure their independence. He goes even further to suggest that we take the Canadian throne for ourselves. Our advisors tell us that in the event of a jihad for the Canadian throne we would no doubt attract a large following of former tributary nations and pious muslims to join us. The Canadian empire seems to be in a delicate balance as forces throughout the nation vie for independence. Taking back our legacy may be the only decision to ensure the prosperity for the Canadian people."

 canadian_events.6.t: "The Question of Involvement"
 canadian_events.6.d: "War has once again come to these fair lands. With the death of the Canadian emperor Fredrick Lafayette, a complicated power struggle has broken out between the former Islamic heirs to the throne and Fredrick’s own son Lawrence. The result of this conflict could decide the fate of this region, whether it will continue to be dominated by the Dynastic status quo or something new. Both sides have sent hundreds of diplomats throughout The Great Lakes in order to curry support from whatever part is open to help. As our neighbors begin to pick sides, it would only be wise if we chose one as well."

 canadian_events.7.t: "Maritime Union"
 canadian_events.7.d: "As the infernal Islamists continue to close in on all sides rats begin to show themselves everywhere. The Maritime states have officially petitioned for their own independence in the middle of this grand conflict. The Maritimes have long been separated from Toronto on a number of different grounds, chief among those being their heritage. Compared to the west, the Maritimes maintained much of their original indigenous identity. As well, generations of cultural melding with the Ainu have further alienated them from the cosmopolitan Canadians. Their move for independence now comes at the most inopportune moment, but might help in preventing our total destruction. If we were to grant them their independence, the Maritimes have sworn to help us defeat the invading Islamists with their fullest resources."

 canadian_events.8.d: "We have finally broken away from the shackles of the Torontan tyrants! Though freedom still lies far away, we have sided ourselves with the Muslim liberators. They have ensured our independence for now, so we must quickly decide who we will be as a nation. Shall we take on the mantle of the Nova Scotians? Or perhaps the Newfoundlanders? Maybe even a Labradorian or Hudsonian would suit us. Luckily, we now have the freedom to choose."

 canadian_events.9.t: "Traitors in the North"
 canadian_events.9.d: "The tratorious Cree of the north have taken advantage of our weakness in an attempt to gain their independence. The heirs to the 13 chiefdoms of the old Anishinaabe federation met in the city of Moosonee and revoked our claim to grand chieftain. Now the new Anishinaabe federation proclaims itself independent and has given an ultimatum to our ruler. They have offered to join our cause against the Islamites with the guarentee that we grant them their independence after the war. While this request comes at an inopportune moment, gaining the full support of the 13 chiefs could turn the tide of this conflict in our favor."

 canadian_events.10.t: "The Fall of Toronto"
 canadian_events.10.d: "We have done the unthinkable. After capturing the city of Toronto, the Great Canadian empire has fallen. The fledgling emperor has fled to his cousins beyond in Winnipeg, never again to hold the throne that was stolen. The terrible injustice served by Pierce Lafayette has finally been righted, and the true heirs to the Maple throne now rule. There is still much to do. The empire is shattered with the maritimes in revolt, the Cree proclaiming their independence, and the devastation of a long war. However now is the time for celebration as we look towards the dawn of a new age. Not an age of tyrants and unjust rule, but of prosperity, liberty, equality, and most of all: unity."
 canadian_events.10.a: "Victory at Last"
 canadian_events.11.t: "We Endure"
 canadian_events.11.d: "Just as always, the Dominion has preserved. From the times after Peter’s death, brothers have waged wars in order to take the mantle of Canada. This was not the first time and will definitely not be the last. Victory has come at a heavy toll. The accomplishments of our forefathers were degraded as the Cree and Maritimes committed their grave betrayal. Even worse, our suzerainty over The Great Lakes has been challenged as many tributaries rose against us. The lands of Sudbury, now leaderless, are in open revolt. Despite this all, we have preserved. We have proved ourselves dominant not only on this earth, but in the eyes of the heavens. He shall have domain from the river unto the ends of the earth."
 canadian_events.11.a: "Victory at Last"
 canadian_events.12.t: "Insurrection"
 canadian_events.12.d: "Word has just reached Toronto that the exiled line of the Lafayette family is attempting to take the Canadian throne for themselves. Generations ago, Jaxon Lafayette was exiled to northern Michigan due to his heretical beliefs. Now he attempts to wage jihad against our Dynastic empire. Many of our own tributary states have begun to pledge themselves to the aims of this new “Kanatan” state. Even worse, the governor of Sudbury himself has given the Islamists a place to land across the lake. Our empire has erupted into chaos as many groups hungrily eye up independence. We must now act decisively in order to crush this threat and ensure that the golden empire of Canada can live to see another generation."
