 paganry_reform_1: "Chart Midgard"
 paganry_reform_1_desc: "Though we have lived on these lands for generations, rarely have we attempted to chart out their structure. The brutish forces of nature and harsh weather have made such a task unfeasible. However, as our nation grows in size, it becomes a greater necessity to see what lurks in the forest. We must gather the explorers of the land and send them abroad."
 paganry_reform_2: "Heathen Allies"
 paganry_reform_2_desc: "Among our heathen neighbors, there are many who share some of our same kin. Generations of intermixing has ensured this. The bond of our blood transcends any petty tribal feud. To survive in this bitter world, we must reach out to the tribes that surround us and ask for their support. Together, we can defeat the coming twilight."
 paganry_reform_3: "Viking Spirit"
 paganry_reform_3_desc: "A long time ago, our ancestors navigated the lands of Niflheim. The cold at their backs, they left for a greener home across the waves. They found Midgard. This wonderful realm holds many luxuries that have allowed our tribe to flourish. Some have claimed that this has made our people soft. We must look back towards the stories of our ancestors and embrace the Viking spirit."
 paganry_reform_4: "Settle Niflheim"
 paganry_reform_4_desc: "The home of our ancestors is a cold and brutal land. Niflheim is constantly battered with icy winds. The realm is filled with all manner of evil creatures, ready to take advantage of any man foolish enough to wander into the cold. If we stick together and learn from the mistakes of these poor souls we might just be able to eke out a living in those terrible lands."
 paganry_reform_5: "Fylgja"
 paganry_reform_5_desc: "Among the spirits of this world, none are more caring than the Fylgja .Each one of these ethereal protectors personally guides the faithful of our tribe to their destiny. Though their guidance is wise, men have been known to stray from their word. We must ensure that our society listens to the Fylgja and acts according to their will."
 paganry_events.1.t: "Pagan Reforms"
 paganry_events.1.d: "It is our tribe’s duty to protect the Gods. Through acting piously and according to their guidance, we can help them to prevent the destruction of this world through Ragnarök. This is a constant battle, one which we must wholly embrace with every part of our being. Through our attempts to reform the faith, we have upset the careful balance and ushered in further røkkr. If we continue to neglect our duties in such a way [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be required to make the ultimate sacrifice. Ascending to heavens [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will be required to personally fight alongside the Gods against the coming darkness."
 paganry_events.1.a: "Everything has a price."
 paganry_events.2.t: "The Álfs"
 paganry_events.2.d: "There are many realms spoken about in the tales of our ancestors. To the east, in the cold and brutish lands, is Niflheim. To the south, past the great and endless sea, is Svartalfheim. Little was known about the lands of the west until now. The arrival of a new people, whom we have begun to call the Álfs, has shown us that there exists many tribes we have not yet come to know. The men of these tribes are callous and evil, tricking the pious of our nation out of their precious goods. They now chop down the forest and make a mess of the earth. This has distracted the Gods. With their attention split between repairing the damage done by these newcomers and the battle against twilight, we must be ever vigilant to ensure that Ragnarök does not come to pass."
 paganry_events.2.a: "Horror!"
 paganry_events.3.t: "Ushered into the dark"
 paganry_events.3.d: "Our efforts to assist the Gods in preventing Ragnarök have failed. Twilight has begun to consume our tribe. Among our brothers and sisters there is a growing discontent with the efforts of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They demand that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] take action, but their cries fall on deaf ears. If we change our course now and make radical changes in efforts, we might be able to give the Gods the aid that they need. In [place_where_the_revolt_is_gonna_spawn.GetName] members of our tribe have had enough. They’ve gathered together and come up with a list of demands for [Root.Moanrch.GetName]. We have been forced into a corner. Shall we accept their demands or deal with the consequences of our rejection?"
 paganry_events.3.a: "Give in."
 paganry_events.3.b: "We will succeed, or die trying."
 paganry_events.4.t: "Battling Twilight"
 paganry_events.4.d: "The battle to prevent Ragnarök is one which is felt throughout all levels of our society. From the youngest child to the oldest sage, all are expected to aid the Gods in their effort to combat the dark. Throughout the fight, there sometimes periods when more is required to ensure that twilight does not fall over Midgard. During times such as these, rulers are required to sacrifice the prosperity of their tribe. We now face such an issue, as the Gods demand that we give more to bolster their waning power. From the many corners of our tribe, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decides that…"
 paganry_events.4.a: "We will support our countrymen."
 paganry_events.4.b: "They army must assist."
 paganry_events.4.c: "The merchants will pitch in."
 paganry_events.4.e: "We will personally deal with the matter"
 paganry_events.4.f: "There is nothing we can do."
 paganry_events.5.t: "Fimbulwinter"
 paganry_events.5.d: "For as long as our tribe has existed, we have seen the Gods battle against the forces of twilight. The wise among our society tell us that Ragnarök will eventually come to pass, yet we have pushed that notion to the back of our minds. A chill fills the air. The fogs of Niflheim have begun to roll into Midgard. Our crops have withered away. The lakes have frozen solid. The beasts of the forest retreat to the west. Every night grows darker. Under the moon’s pale glow, one can hear a deep rumble in the distance. While we may doubt the elders in our mind, the fear in our heart tells the truth: Fimbulwinter approaches."
 paganry_events.5.a: "The cold sets in."
 paganry_events.6.t: "Old Gods"
 paganry_events.6.d: "Free from the battle against twilight, the Gods can finally bestow blessings upon our tribe. In a time before many in our tribe were born, our ancestors worked side by side with the divine. With the help of Freya, children grew to be strong members of the tribe. With the help of Tor, the men of the tribe were trained to defeat creatures of the woods. With the help of Odin, the chieftain was taught how to best lead the tribe through periods of difficulty. With the help of Tyr, our ancestors were taught how to conquer the sea. With the help of Njord, the merchants were able to procure the most exotic goods. With the help of Snotra, our elders were given the secrets of the universe. Let us call upon the blessings of these Gods to help us now as they once did."

 paganry_events.7.t: "Coven Rivalry"
 paganry_events.7.d: "Among the pious of our tribe, there are some who vary in their practice and belief. Like minded individuals of this type have segregated themselves into separate covens. While these groups typically share cordial relationships, a recent disagreement over a sacred site has led to a conflict between many covens within our tribe. Such conflicts are not matters of the chieftain. Mediation is to be done by the common members. However, this skirmish has come to distract many of our fellow tribesmen from their important duties. Perhaps [Root.Monarch.GetName] should step in and settle this matter, just this once."
 paganry_events.7.a: "Let them fight."
 paganry_events.7.b: "Split them up."
 paganry_events.8.t: "True Will"
 paganry_events.8.d: "As humans, we are given the choice to pursue whatever we wish within this life. Our ancestors tell us that this great gift was granted to our race by the Gods long ago. While the creatures of the forest are to be guided by beastial instincts, man is to be able to make his own way. Though we may have the agency to do as we wish, every individual has a greater purpose which they have been gifted with. The sages among our tribe call this our”True Will.” One’s true will is their calling. Once found, they are to enjoy its pursuit until the end of their days. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has recently done some searching and found the nature of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] true will to be…"
 paganry_events.8.a: "Peace."
 paganry_events.8.b: "Prosperity."
 paganry_events.8.c: "Knowledge."
 paganry_events.9.t: "Álf Missionaries"
 paganry_events.9.d: "The infernal Álf, who have brought only pestilence and ruin from across the waves, have begun to meddle in the affairs of our tribes. Bearing crosses and capes, the “missionaries” among them have come to convert our people to their foreign faith. Of course, we would normally scare off their attempts and continue with our lives, but some of our elders have pointed out that their presence could potentially benefit our tribe. While they are not wise, the Álfs do hold a vast number of complicated gizmos and libraries of useful knowledge. If we let them linger in our nation, we could potentially learn from their people and become more prosperous."
 paganry_events.9.a: "Kick them out."
 paganry_events.9.b: "Let them pass."
