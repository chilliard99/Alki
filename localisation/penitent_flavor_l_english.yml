 penitent_events.1.t: "Master of Creation"
 penitent_events.1.d: "In a time before time, Ilohymn made the world. From him, the Gods were birthed and he was made weaker for it. He made man to keep the Gods in check, but man grew to be callous and disruptive. He punished humanity. Those that survived swore to repent. We have carried this story with us for generations. The elders of our state teach our children to remember and repent as their forefathers did before them. Through carrying out this great deed, the elders state that we have been granted a blessing by Ilohymn. Let us not waste this great opportunity and give thanks to the ones above."

 penitent_events.2.t: "Ilohymn's Wrath"
 penitent_events.2.d: "Ilohymn brought about the fall of man. The reasons for his doing are different depending on the story, but all center on the hubris of man. Through either their ignorance or some slight against the Gods, they inspired the wrath of Ilohymn. Ever since this time, our people have been forced to repent for the sins of the past and live pious lives. Our nation has come to stray from this purpose as we have taken land which we have no claim to own. Many within our state now believe that we will inspire the wrath of the creator and have raised arms to remove us as their ruler. We must act quickly to either suppress their revolt or take responsibility for the current state of affairs."
 penitent_events.2.a: "Silence all who dissent!"
 penitent_events.2.b: "We are at fault."
 penitent_events.3.t: "Called to Explore"
 penitent_events.3.d: "Our ruler has adopted the guidance of Jahway. In his divine wisdom, the God has pointed our people towards the edges of our nation. In the empty wasteland beyond, we shall find riches and new people to bring to his glory. However, some of the elders within our state are hesitant. If we are to grow too large and too prosperous, we might forget the lessons of the past. Forgetting to repent for man's hubris will draw the ire of Ilohymn and once again plunge us into an age of darkness. We must carefully consider our next steps, lest we upset the order so carefully crafted by those that came before us."
 penitent_events.3.a: "Pray Jahway guide us!"
 penitent_events.3.b: "Ambition will bring about the fall of man."
 penitent_events.4.t: "Fair Waters"
 penitent_events.4.d: "Across the waves we will find our salvation. Tales of our ancestors speak of lands beyond the sea which many called home. Some believe that the men of these lands were the most haughty in the past, leading Ilohymn to bury them beneath the waves. While we doubt the truth of such claims, there has been no way for us to disprove them until now. The most curious of our nation now ask us to commune with jahway and request his guidance into the great unknown. Let us gather the elders and seek their wisdom on what we shall ask of Jahway. May he grant us his blessing and continue to provide us with positive change."
 penitent_events.4.a: "Jahway will give us strength."
 penitent_events.4.b: "Jahway will inspire the pious to serve."
 penitent_events.4.c: "Jahway will reveal riches in lands far away."
 penitent_events.5.t: "The Prideful Ones"
 penitent_events.5.d: "When Ilohymn unleashed his wrath unto man, he created the concept of suffering and birthed Jihouva. As Penitents, we must embrace our suffering and linger with it, so that one day we may be forgiven for the mistakes of our forefathers. From across the waves, some new men have arrived at our borders. They claim to have the truth of the world and believe us to be confused as to the true nature of our faith. Their pride, their greed, and their bloodlust will be the death of us all. With the guidance of Jihouva, we will teach these arrogant sort suffering."
 penitent_events.5.a: "They will learn to repent."
 penitent_events.6.t: "Message from Jahouva"
 penitent_events.6.d: "After the fall of man, Jihouva gave wisdom unto humanity so that they may survive the dark. He spoke to them through a burning bush. He told them of their mistakes and instructed them on how they might survive. Jihouva has continued to meddle in the nations of man, checking in and providing guidance for those who need it. News has emerged from the countryside of a great stone tablet. It is said to contain a message from Jihouva himself, though the meaning of its content is quite vague. Our scholars are split on what to take away from it. Half believe that Jihouva has instructed us to make war against our neighbors, while the other half believe that we must seek peace. After listening to both sides of the argument [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided that the tablet speaks of…"

 penitent_events.6.b: "Peace"
 penitent_events.7.t: "Ohlord's Great Mercey"
 penitent_events.7.d: "The mercy of Ohlord has helped man to recover from the fall. Ilohymn had stolen away all prosperity from man after his punishment and set Jihouva to promote suffering, but Ohlord hid a small portion of the prosperity away. When man was ready, he sprinkled it across the land and allowed it to seep into the earth. Ever since this time we have been eternally grateful for Ohlord’s mercy. Our thanks have not gone unnoticed, as Ohlord has granted our nation a blessing. The elders have gathered around [Root.Monarch.GetName] and eagerly wait for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] judgment. After carefully considering all the options, [Root.Monarch.GetName] chose…"

 penitent_events.7.b: "Peace among all nations."
 penitent_events.7.c: "The evil fear his influence."
 penitent_events.8.t: "A Second Chance"
 penitent_events.8.d: "Man’s fall was his own doing. Those who came after were meant to suffer. Ilohymn originally granted man life and his own glory, but snatched it all away once he found out of their sin. We were meant to suffer in the dark forever, but the gracious Ohlord gave us a second chance. In a moment of kindness, the God hid a portion of prosperity from Ilohymn and kept its existence a secret. When man was ready, he scattered pieces of prosperity across the land and let them sink into the earth. We now enjoy a portion of their bliss to this day. This second chance has inspired many throughout our nation to reconsider their anger at our rule. In a moment of forgiveness they have decided to do as Ohlord did in the past and give us a second chance. Let us pray that we do not disappoint them again."
 penitent_events.8.a: "We are blessed with his grace."
 penitent_events.9.t: "Disrupting Father's Order"
 penitent_events.9.d: "Father has little concern for the lives of man, yet is the God most involved in their existence. His role as the protector of justice means that he is constantly observing and meddling in the world. After the fall of man, Ilohymn placed him in the position so that man would never succumb to such dredges again. He does not care how prosperous or brutish the lives of men are as long as the balance is maintained. We have done much to disrupt the natural balance through allowing the unrepentant to exist within our nation. Their very presence tips the scales. In [place_where_the_order_was_gettin_disrupted.GetName], devoted acolytes of Father have begun to raise arms against our leadership and demand that we take action against these heathens."
 penitent_events.9.a: "Silence those who speak out."
 penitent_events.9.b: "We have failed him."
 penitent_events.10.t: "Perserved Wisdom"
 penitent_events.10.d: "Those that are able to speak with Father, a group which is exceedingly rare, have come to learn of his strange wisdom. The collection of his observations and rules is told through a series of stories known as the Byebull. This Byebull is preserved by his acolytes and kept secret to the general public. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s great reverence towards the father has attracted the attention of these groups. If [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wishes, the acolytes will teach [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] the stories of the ByeBull. With such ancient wisdom, it is likely that [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be able to much more effectively serve [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people."
 penitent_events.10.a: "Continue the tradition."
 penitent_events.10.b: "Carve a new path."
