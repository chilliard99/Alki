 promise_beyond_title: "Promise Beyond"
 promise_beyond_desc: "Few have ventured beyond the Antilles and even fewer have returned to tell the tale. In the 8th century, the great sailor Javiar Garcia navigated the Middle Seas, from California to Canada, in order to secure an alliance for our royal family. During the 12th century, another one of our brave countrymen, Louis Velazquez, navigated the waters of the Malaysian sea and contacted the Brazilian emperor. History has come to repeat itself once again as word spreads of an entire world across the sea ripe for the taking. We must act quickly to confirm these rumors for ourselves. Glory does not wait."
 co_ye_what_title: "Co..Ye..What?"
 co_ye_what_desc: "In a stroke of luck we have come across a new world across the waves. In particular, the renowned explorer Pablo Velazquez landed on a continent which has come to share his name: Pablonia. Our ships have landed on its fertile shores and filled themselves to the gills with all manner of ivory, salt, and  gemstones. Our initial interactions with the natives of the region have proved confusing as they speak no recognizable language our ears have ever heard. Through trial and error we have found that they call this land Coyemi which has become quickly adopted as the name of the region by settlers. We must work to stake a claim on this continent before any other nation tries to steal its riches for themselves."
 rounding_the_cape_cuba_title: "Rounding the Cape"
 rounding_the_cape_cuba_desc: "Navigating the waters to the north of Coyemia has proven exceedingly difficult. The Green Sea is constantly brewing with dense storms which make travel impossible. Our journeys south have proven far more successful. The bottom of the continent is almost as lucrative as the top, being filled with valuable diamonds and heaps of gold. Many from our nation have already begun to rush to the new world, it would do us well to claim more land in the south to accommodate them. Building more colonies and expanding existing ones will ensure that Pablonia will remain within Cuban hands."
 settling_ethiopia_title: "Settling Ethiopia"
 settling_ethiopia_desc: "The final untouched portion of this continent now presents itself before us: Ethiopia. The natives of this region have nearly gone extinct from the presence of disease, but the ruins of their cities indicate that they were once the center of Pablonian civilization. Massive irrigation system, detailed tapestries of various cloths and large temple complexes all adorn this region's countryside. Our only task now is to claim the lands which they die upon, let us make sure their legacy is remembered through our own success."
 consolidate_coyemia_title: "Consolidate Coyemia"
 consolidate_coyemia_desc: "Now that we have struck a claim on this continent, it is important that we work towards consolidating our holdings to fully exploit the land's resources. First it is necessary to expand our colony in Coyemia. The region serves as the primary exit point for all trade flowing out of the continent, so it is necessary that we improve its many ports and ensure that all goods reach their proper destination. Crafting roads, expanding dockyards, and settling more land will put us in the proper place to ramp up production throughout the rest of the continent."
 cape_colony_cuba_title: "Cape Colony"
 cape_colony_cuba_desc: "The Cape's many resources will prove extremely lucrative if we can properly export them. Outside of simply exploiting the natural gem and gold resources of the region, it could prove even more lucrative to encourage the growing of cash crops. In Yoroppa, many of the nations of America have already found success in growing tobacco and cotton, perhaps we should choose a similar good and encourage our settlers to grow it here."
 enlarge_ethiopia_title: "Expand Ethiopia"
 enlarge_ethiopia_desc: "Expanding our Ethiopian colony will help us to cover the last portion of the continent. Ethiopia proved to be an incredibly useful territory, as most trade from Endea flows through the Lafayette strait. Even before our arrival, many natives would travel in canoes up the strait and along the coast in order to sell their wares abroad. Developing existing settlements, constructing more connections to other regions, improving our port cities, and encouraging the arrival of settlers will help us to finally tame the last corner of Pablonia."
 purge_the_natives_title: "Purge the Natives"
 purge_the_natives_desc: "The natives of this continent have proven to be the last roadblock to our total hegemony over Pablonia. When we originally arrived centuries ago, the natives were much more numerous. However, a great pestilence has spread across the land and caused the collapse of most resistance. Those that have survived the affair have sought peace with our nation at all costs, which has left us in the unenviable position of being the aggressors against a broken people. Though the task is brutal, it must be done in order to assure that Pablonia forever lies in our grasp."
 pablonia_whole_title: "Pablonia Whole"
 pablonia_whole_desc: "With the natives of this continent purged, we can finally go forward with settling the last corners of the land. Settlers from our island are beginning to pour onto the continent en masse looking for new opportunities, we must ensure that each is given their proper reward. Further developing centers of civilization and connecting the continent with roadways would go far in promoting internal cohesion and settlement of the interior."
 colonial_hegemon_cuba_title: "Colonial Hegemon"
 colonial_hegemon_cuba_desc: "From humble origins we have come to dominate an entire continent, yet there lies so many more untapped opportunities across the waves. The lands of Akilineq are rich beyond imagination and lie just within our grasp, we must make use of their wealth. Every man who wishes to make a fortune, look to the frontier for fortune favors the bold!"
 prepare_a_trading_fleet_title: "The Peacetime Fleet"
 prepare_a_trading_fleet_desc: "Despite our largely maritime nature we do not possess a large wartime fleet. Instead, we rely on nobles in order to refit their own vessels to face combat. With our recent move towards complete peace, it would be wise to gear our own royal navy towards trade. By investing in lighter crafts with large hulls, we could more effectively carry sugar and spices throughout the Caribbean and beyond. It would also be wise to hire a talented admiral to manage the fleet’s affairs in order to encourage efficiency. Hopefully these investments will pay for themselves with a stronger commercial presence."
 dominate_antillean_trade_title: "Antillean Trade"
 dominate_antillean_trade_desc: "For centuries, our state has been relied upon to deliver the exotic goods of Japan, Brazil, and Colombia to the Mexican continent. While this has granted us immeasurable wealth, it has also brought with it a unique set of problems. The cost of maintaining large docks puts a heavy strain on royal coffers, but is absolutely necessary if we are to output an acceptable volume of goods. We are presented with this same condondrum once again as we look towards implementing many new marketplaces throughout our nation. While these marketplaces might not pay for themselves in the short term, they will double their wealth once we consolidate the Antillean trade."
 domestic_ports_cuba_title: "Domestic Ports"
 domestic_ports_cuba_desc: "In the few times this island has become shattered amongst various dukes, the power of their states has always centered around the key ports of trade. The cities of Havana, Sancti Spiritus, Camaguey, and Bayamo have become capitals of their respective areas due to their commercial dominance. It would be wise of us to develop these key centers of trade and expand their own infrastructure in order to match the growing amount of goods flowing in from the new world."
 strong_foreign_presence_cuba_title: "Strong Foreign Presence"
 strong_foreign_presence_cuba_desc: "Beyond the Antillean trade, our foreign settlements hold a glut of wealth in their natural resources. However, the difficulty of ruling these wayward territories could lead to inefficiency in tapping into their riches. In order to solve this issue, we could let independent trading companies manage our finances in the region. While these would be royally controlled, they would be free from most of our bureaucratic oversight and nearly lawless. Converting new territories into companies should be a high priority during our expansion."
 envy_of_the_tides_title: "Envy of the Tides"
 envy_of_the_tides_desc: "With the glut of trade flowing in from Akilineq and Pablonia, it has become difficult to control all of the Antillean trade. We must continue our efforts to assert our trade hegemony in order to protect our peace abroad. By ensuring our commercial dominance, we can use the soft power of our trade to influence the world around us. He who controls the trade, controls the world."
 infiltrate_the_kings_title: "Infiltrate the Kings"
 infiltrate_the_kings_desc: "The kings of Cuba are an antiquated remnant of our long history. In a time before more efficient means of government, the kings were necessary in order to rule over the entire island. Now they stand as the last point of resistance to our control of the state. If we are to fully exert our will over the island, we will need to first rid ourselves of these kings. Infiltrating their courts and distracting them with a number of different useless tasks will allow us to buy time before taking more decisive action."
 strike_down_protections_title: "Strike down Protections"
 strike_down_protections_desc: "Historically, the various extra kings of our state are meant to check the power of our monarch. However during times of crisis the power is consolidated into a single ruler, essentially preventing resistance from the other kings. The recent troubles surrounding the Bahamas could be spun into a reason for tightening control, but it is likely that the kings will become clued into our plans. If we wait to revoke their protection until we are ready to claim absolute power, they will not have the time to plot against us."
 landing_in_florida_title: "Landing in Florida"
 landing_in_florida_desc: "While our empire has not expanded far throughout its history, we have continuously held an interest in southern Florida. The city of Miami has long held close ties to our state in its culture and dialect of the Misr language. If we were to engage in a campaign of conquest for the island of Florida, the city of Miami would logically follow as the first landing point for our forces."
 running_up_the_nile_title: "Running up the Nile"
 running_up_the_nile_desc: "Beyond the city of Miami, the sugar plantations that surround Okechobee could prove to a lucrative addition to our empire. While our own plantations are mostly privately managed by a rich class of sugar barons, the sugar plantations of Florida have long been tied into the rulers of the state. The only deviation from this norm came during the Kyushu conquest of the island during which the sugar resources were given to its own private Hana company. During that time, sugar production on the island doubled and came to rival our own. We must conquer these lands before they figure out how to actually manage their resources."
 imperial_flower_title: "Imperial Flower"
 imperial_flower_desc: "The northern portion of the Floridian isle shares many differences from the south. Notably for our purposes, they are far more resistant to conversion. The Zahran faith finds its origins in the north as the ancient Egyptians were said to have received the word of Amun from the ancient city of Cairo. Whatever their supposed origin, we must ensure that they come to bask in the light of the lord. Melding elements of our own faith with their beliefs will assist us in gently guiding them to salvation."
 recovering_the_bahamas_title: "Recovering the Bahamas"
 recovering_the_bahamas_desc: "Our recent conquest of the Bahamas has brought with it a lot of chaos. For nearly 40 years our nation had been at peace before we decided to expand into the territory. The war itself was an easy affair, yet the Bahamanians have been incredibly resistant to our rule. With our populace already up in arms with the recent war, we are placed in a precarious situation. We must be careful to maintain peace and work towards making the Bahamas a core part of our empire."
 assemble_a_cabinent_cuba_title: "Assemble a Cabinent"
 assemble_a_cabinent_cuba_desc: "In order to take total control of the state we will need to have the expertise of several advisors. The difficult part of this task will be maintaining a set of advisors that are loyal to our cause, no matter how bloody the task gets. With the glut of talent present in our nation there is no doubt the right people for the job are somewhere, we just need to find them."
 prepare_the_capital_title: "Prepare the Capital"
 prepare_the_capital_desc: "Despite being the home of our administration, Havana is staunchly opposed to the idea of bloodshed. The people of the capital will likely resist our attempt at claiming total power, so our advisors have come up with the idea of intentionally weakening its defenses in case of a revolt. During the expansion of Havana, we can include some serious design flaws within the city’s walls which could assist the army in stopping dissent at the capital."
 spring_the_trap_title: "Spring the Trap"
 spring_the_trap_desc: "The hour of our plans is finally coming to pass. In a quick move, we will proclaim ourselves as the single sole monarch of the state and abolish the parliaments of the land. At the same time, the military will put down any revolts while we remove all checks on our own power. If the other kings rebel against us, they will be slaughtered like the traitors they are. In the aftermath we will rebuild a more glorious nation in the ashes of the old."
 iron_hand_of_the_state_title: "Iron Hand of The State"
 iron_hand_of_the_state_desc: "Our plan has succeeded, yet there is still work to do before we can fully enforce our rule. The pockets of dissent across our state still burn bright, but with the diligent work of our soldiers will reduce them to cinders. Just the same, the other kings continue their feeble attempts at independence. Once all of this is dealt with, Cuba will finally be unshackled from her tradition and free to decide her own fate."
 consolidate_the_east_title: "Consolidate the East"
 consolidate_the_east_desc: "There are two portions of the Western Caribbean that continue to resist our rule: Jamaica and the Caicos. The former was originally settled by our people during the first century, but quickly came to its own identity and split from our empire. The latter has continuously been a haven for pirates and all manner of different thieves throughout its history. By adding both of these states to our collection, we will return the Western Antilles to the Cuban banner for the first time in centuries."
 handling_the_haitians_title: "Handling the Haitians"
 handling_the_haitians_desc: "Our expansion into the eastern Caribbean should start with the island of Hispaniola. Focusing on the eastern half first, the nations of Haiti will make easy prey. While the island is certainly well developed, the western portion has a significantly smaller population when compared to the east. This smaller population will be reflected in a smaller military which will no doubt fall beneath our might."
 uniting_hispaniola_title: "Uniting Hispaniola"
 uniting_hispaniola_desc: "As our soldiers now rest on the Haitian border, their next path for expansion is clear. The eastward march won’t be difficult, but it will be bloody. The eastern half of Hispaniola features some of the most populated cities in the entire world. While we have devoted ourselves to this new path of expansion, we must take care to prevent needless bloodshed. No doubt by channeling our state’s long history of peace, we can make the coming war less devastating."
 boricuan_bashing_title: "Boricuan Bashing"
 boricuan_bashing_desc: "The island of Hispaniola only forms a portion of the eastern Antilles. In the past, the isle of Puerto Rico served as the farthest reaches of civilization in the Caribbean. Beyond its shores were only tribal natives and endless waves. In our modern age we have discovered continents beyond the sea and settled most of the islands, yet it still is important to remember the essential role this island once served. No matter its former status, Puerto Rico will soon become a valuable part of our empire."
 all_of_the_isles_title: "All of the Isles"
 all_of_the_isles_desc: "The small isles which make up the little Antilles will finally complete our Caribbean empire. From Havana to Barbados, our great empire will rule over all of the waves. This complete maritime supremacy will grant us immeasurable naval and commercial influence. As the world expands into this age of global empires, we will have a keen advantage along the waves."
 prosperity_in_havanna_title: "Prosperity in Havanna"
 prosperity_in_havanna_desc: "The Cespedes family of Havana has ruled over Cuba for the past 4 centuries. The previous kingdom was shattered at the hands of the Monroevian horde which set sail from New Orleans in order to establish maritime ports on the island. The nearly 100 years of peace had left the old administration complacent and weak which the Monroevians exploited. After losing major battles at Havana and Nueva Bermeja, the kingdom signed a peace which split the island in half. The western portion of the island became a hub for Patriotic merchants who traded their goods along the Eastern Seaboard. When the Monroevian horde finally fell during the Northern crusades, the western half of the island rebelled and conquered the east. The city of Havana holds this rich history in its streets which are still scratched with the seige weapons of yore. We must invest in its expansion in order to protect this rich legacy."
 faithful_shores_title: "Faithful Shores"
 faithful_shores_desc: "Our conversion to Catholicism came from the heavy insistence of King Marco III Cespedes. His own conversion caused waves of instability across the country, but his subsequent invitation to the missionaries of the mainland almost led to outright revolt. The east was especially resistant, the entrenched Santarian sugar barons were faithful until their last breath. However, as generations passed, the island came to more or less accept the status quo and follow the faith dutifully. As a consequence of our recent conversion, we have little monuments for our lord. We must build some churches and chapels to ensure that our faith is made clear to the heavens."
 professional_craftsmen_title: "Professional Craftsmen"
 professional_craftsmen_desc: "With the glut of wealth flowing in from the Antilles, it is only natural that we use it to enrich our own people. While our state prides itself on its natural sugars and tobaccos, there are many talented craftsmen who are without the proper means to create their goods. In particular, the clothworkers of Santiago are renowned for their beautiful fabrics which are created out of cotton. If we were to build several workshops it is likely that many of our citizens might be able to expand their productions and create more valuable goods."
 mass_urbanization_title: "Mass Urbanization"
 mass_urbanization_desc: "The lack of any bloodshed has caused our island’s population to skyrocket. Many of these new citizens are flocking to the cities in order to etch out a successful existence learning a trade and working in one of our many new workshops. However, most of these citizens have been met with poor conditions as these legacy cities attempt to accommodate a population too large for their intended capacity. We must work to develop these cities to ensure that they can carry all the talent that falls into their walls."
 improving_internal_cohesion_title: "Internal Cohesion"
 improving_internal_cohesion_desc: "With the recent development of our larger cities, the rest of our country looks primitive in comparison. Through building more roads and investing in each province’s infrastructure, we can ensure that our country has a sense of internal cohesion. By expanding our hinterlands we can also hope to increase our state’s agricultural output. More food brings a larger population, which in turn enriches our state with more taxes."
 island_industrialization_title: "Island Industries"
 island_industrialization_desc: "With an island as currently packed as ours, it is important that we manage our resources to fully extract their utility. Using some of our new income on constructing large manufacturers could help us to exploit Cuba’s natural resources more efficiently. Building larger plantations and massive textile manufactories would go far in ensuring that our state never needs to worry about running out of goods. In a similar vein we need to more efficiently manage our populace in order to extract the most utility from them. Increasing our presence in the different areas of our country we can more effectively deploy our bureaucracy in their management."
 paradise_on_earth_title: "Paradise on Earth"
 paradise_on_earth_desc: "There are no lands on this earth which rival our state’s grandeur, yet there are still more sublime heights to reach. With our peace we have all of the resources available to reach a level of development unheard of even in the imaginations of philosophers. Greater development, more efficient cities, and further technological research will bring us one step closer to paradise on earth."
 classical_thoughts_cuba_title: "Classical Thoughts"
 classical_thoughts_cuba_desc: "The Classicalism movement has arrived at our shores and melds with our proclamation for peace. During times of peace academics and artists are given the chance to thrive. Without war, Patrons have nothing but the talented man to spend their money on. As we continue in our efforts to avoid bloodshed, it would do us well to embrace this movement’s message and enrich our state with its gifts of artistry."
 island_paridise_title: "Island Paradise"
 island_paridise_desc: "After our state has accomplished twenty years of peace we will finally restore ourselves to a state of sublime excellence. Throughout the ages, many have characterized our home as an island paradise. This reputation brought with it a steady flow of talent as most attempted to escape the horrors of war on the continent. Coupled with the serene nature of our island’s environment, it is no wonder that the reputation stuck."
 the_long_peace_title: "The Long Peace"
 the_long_peace_desc: "Without war, our state has routinely fallen into the task of domestic expansion to occupy its government. Focusing on our capital, we must work to ensure that our people are given the most sublime city to match the state of their existence. Building more roads, expanding public works, and making the city more liveable will go a long way in turning our capital into a paradise that rivals all others."
 generational_peace_title: "Generational Peace"
 generational_peace_desc: "Through sixty years of peace our nation should be able to accomplish some impossible feats. During the long peace of the 11th century, our state managed to lace the entire island with elaborate roadways. Every trader had an optimal route along which he could pass his goods. Over the centuries this roadway has collapsed into ruin, we must work to restore its former glory so our traders can prosper in this same way once again."
 true_pacifist_title: "True Pacifist"
 true_pacifist_desc: "Eighty years of peace is a task which few nations could accomplish. Through building up our nation throughout this time, we should have no issue in claiming the title as the world’s most advanced nation. While the other powers of the world waste their time in petty conflicts and spill countless lives, our serene kingdom will silently surpass them by means of peace. The way of the pacifist truly holds the most fruitful outcomes."
 pax_cubana_mission_title: "Pax Cubana"
 pax_cubana_mission_desc: "There have only been a few periods during the history of our state in which we have reached a century of peace. Achieving such a lofty goal seems nearly impossible, but our state has never been constrained by what is possible. Through the ages we have avoided the cravings for bloodshed and managed to rise above all other nations. We now represent more than just our own nation with our message, but the race of man himself. For the sake of our own humanity, we must reach a century of peace."
 tranquility_cuba_title: "Tranquility"
 tranquility_cuba_desc: "Through a century of peace we have done what little others can ever hope to accomplish, yet there is always a greater height we can reach. The Cuban empire of antiquity existed in a state of peace for 600 years before its fall by the hands of the Guadalupe empire. If we are to prove ourselves as a truly tranquil empire, we must endure for another century without bloodshed."
 gain_army_support_title: "Gain Army Support"
 gain_army_support_desc: "Having the support of the military will be essential if we are to take total control over the island. Without their absolute loyalty, it is likely some portion of their forces will side with one of the kings and snuff out our revolution. As it stands, the military is more loyal to the idea of peace than our own plans. Hiring some new generals to help plan out our ascendancy and shuffling around the troops would go a long way in ensuring that our plans go off without a hitch."
 down_to_brass_tacks_title: "Down to Brass Tacks"
 down_to_brass_tacks_desc: "Now that we have gotten the military on our side, we must fully plan out the details of our plot. It is likely that many will raise arms against our power grasp, so the army will need to be spread throughout the country in order to ensure compliance. While it is unlikely that the other kings will allow the military into their own cities due to their paranoia, training the army in similar terrain could help to prevent bloodshed. This plan will require an unprecedented level of coordination in order to succeed, we must make sure our military is properly trained."
 mapping_japan_title: "Mapping Japan"
 mapping_japan_desc: "During our conquests of the Bahamas, we managed to take the island of Tanegashima from one of their allies. Despite our proximity to the Japanese isles, we have rarely ever dealt with them directly. Instead, merchants typically carry goods through our borders and bring our goods back with them. If we are to invade into the islands, it would be wise to learn more about their lands to gain an advantage."
 crushing_kyushu_title: "Crushing Kyushu"
 crushing_kyushu_desc: "One of the few Japanese realms that we have come into conflict with was the Kyushan empire. During its height, the Kyushuans challenged our naval supremacy and control over the Bahamas. It is due to the Kyushans that we lost control of the islands to begin with, so it is only natural that we pay them a visit and take revenge. With our new knowledge of the region, our armies will make quick work of their shattered state."
 halting_hiroshima_title: "Halting Hiroshima"
 halting_hiroshima_desc: "While many of the goods produced in the Seto sea are present in other continents, few are of the quality produced in the region. For example, while Texas provides much of the Mexican continent and beyond with beef, their quality does not come close to the meats of Kobe. Their skilled pottery, dyes, and incense would prove to be valuable assets to our empire’s trade network."
 setos_end_title: "Seto's End"
 setos_end_desc: "The last portions of the Seto sea lie just within our grasp. Managing the territory after its conquest will prove to be the more challenging task, however many of our advisors have come up with a solution. Placing the region in the control of a royal trade company could fully allow us to exploit the region’s resources. Not only would this allow the previous network of merchants to continue their travels unfazed, it will likely grow the existing networks by allowing for greater investments."
 colonize_the_windwards_title: "Colonize the Windwards"
 colonize_the_windwards_desc: "Despite the many attempts of our forefathers we have so far been unsuccessful in claiming the Eastern Antilles. In the 13th century, a massive colonization project undertaken by the then king Ruben the Terrible failed spectacularly when the hurricane season wiped out the settlement. Since this time, the isles have become home to the Puerto Rican and Guadalupe Kingdoms. It would do us well to succeed where our forefathers failed and claim an island for ourselves before these kingdoms take them all."
 the_amazonian_company_title: "Amazonian Company"
 the_amazonian_company_desc: "Our position in the Caribbean has allowed us to dominate the spice trade for centuries, however a new threat is emerging to our south. As the Colombian state begins to spread into the jungle, they get closer to the Brazilian empire. If they were to undercut our trade and transport the spices along the Guyana coast, they could seriously threaten our trade. In order to solve this crisis before it occurs, our advisors have suggested that we found a trading company in the south focused around key ports in the region."
 sublime_sumatra_title: "Sublime Sumatra"
 sublime_sumatra_desc: "Beyond the Amazons and Brazil there is a large uncolonized chunk of land ripe for the taking. The island of Sumatra could prove to be supremely useful for its potential to act as our own independent source for spices. If we were to assert a sizable presence on the island we would no longer be beholden to the Brazilians for their spices. The first step towards accomplishing this goal must be to settle at least one port on the island."
 consolidate_east_nusantara_title: "East Nusantara"
 consolidate_east_nusantara_desc: "With the discovery of the new lands of Akilineq and Pablonia, it is more important than ever that we attempt to claim the island of Sumatra and assert our presence in Malaysia. By placing ourselves on the outskirts of the Brazilian state we are able to sell new goods from our other colonies to their growing populace. From Sumatra we also have easy access to the large markets of the Andean world. Claiming the rest of this island is essential if we are to prosper in this age of global empires."
 challenging_the_giant_title: "Challenging the Giant"
 challenging_the_giant_desc: "At its current size, the Brazilian empire has outlived its usefulness to our own state. While its populace is a worthy market, the government has become too restrictive to our expansion in the Malaysian sea. Since war is inevitable between our nations, it would be wise to make sure we have the proper tools in order to succeed. Specially trained marines and a large navy will ensure that we are able to put on a proper offensive against the giant of Malaysia."
 island_hopping_cuba_title: "Island Hopping"
 island_hopping_cuba_desc: "In order to finally defeat the Brazilian empire, we will need to eliminate their presence from every island in Malaysia. The first island in this path is Sulawesi, which produces a significant portion of the empire’s spices and copper. Without copper, the Brazilians will be unable to produce ammunition for their primitive cannons and will be easy prey to our superior firepower. By taking Sulawesi, we will come one step closer to finally taking the city of Rio de Janeiro."
 heart_of_the_beast_title: "Heart of the Beast"
 heart_of_the_beast_desc: "The capital of the Brazilian empire lies just outside of our grasp. In the recounts of his travels, the famed explorer Javier Garcia spoke of the absolute decadence of the Brazilian capital. His description of their lavish wealth and grand parliament created a stark image within the Mexican mindset. However, the reality of this empire is far more disappointing than its depictions in his text. They are backwards and weak, a relic of some bygone age. We should finally put them out of their misery and save them from embarrassment."
 malaysian_hegemon_title: "Malaysian Hegemon"
 malaysian_hegemon_desc: "The final scraps of the Brazilian empire litter the rest of Malaysia, so we might as well claim the entire region as our own. In our attempts to become closer to the Brazilians, we have taken on their role. The nations of the world now look to us for their nutmeg and cloves. We hold a navy feared throughout the Malaysia sea and we exert our influence across the world with our trade. This powerful blessing must be protected so that we do not end up like our predecessors in Rio."

 cuban_events.2.t: "Wartime Aversion"
 cuban_events.2.d: "The people of Cuba share a peculiar aversion to any manner of warfare. Throughout the ages, this consensus has greatly troubled the state, as their attempts at expansion are typically met with heavy domestic resistance. Conversely, the people of the Cuban state are very accustomed to peace and become far more subservient under longer periods without warfare. Just a few years ago, we engaged in an island hopping campaign to take control of the Bahamas which caused our population to grow restless. The aftermath of this short conflict can be felt throughout the island as many plan to air their grievances with our actions. This cycle of war, anger, and resignation has repeated countless times throughout our state’s history in the wake of nearly every conflict. However, not every war carries with it this burden, only those engaged against our neighbors on the Mexican continent and great powers. Foreign conflicts outside of our state’s bounds do bring with them the same anger from our populace. We must ensure that we manage this aspect of our state in order to exploit its benefits and avoid collapse."
 cuban_events.2.a: "Interesting"
 cuban_events.3.t: "Five Years of Peace"
 cuban_events.3.d: "After five years of peace the memory of war still exists within the minds of our people, but their anger has begun to subside. Many times throughout history, foolish kings of this isle have forgotten just how much our citizens detest warfare. Five years after our last conquest, the citizens of this nation still buck against our administration and prevent us from regaining our prosperity. By this time, most soldiers have returned to their normal lives as craftsmen or farmers in the countryside. While they are ready to serve our realm when given notice, they likely much prefer the simpler life among the common man. For their sake, we must ensure that five years of peace rolls over into ten."
 cuban_events.3.a: "Perfect"
 cuban_events.4.t: "Ten Years of Peace"
 cuban_events.4.d: "After ten years of peace most of our realm has returned to its normal function. The plots of revolutionaries have mostly faded into memory and their attempts to harm our administration bring little consequence. From city to city, a different air of relief can be felt in the air. A relief that our island paradise will remain without tarnish in a peaceful tranquility. While our people have not yet become engrossed in their own peacetime endeavors, they are more clear minded now than before. In addition, peace has brought prosperity for our own realm. The generation of men allowed to flourish under peace have grown wealthy and, by extension, greatly taxable. For their sake, we must ensure that ten years of peace rolls over into twenty."
 cuban_events.4.a: "Perfect"
 cuban_events.5.t: "Twenty Years of Peace"
 cuban_events.5.d: "After twenty years of peace our realm begins to thrive under its normal circumstances. Throughout the history of this island, many administrations have made use of their peace to promote progress among the populace. By funding artists, expanding infrastructure, and building churches previous administrations have used the prosperity of peace in order to make Cuba the most developed realm in the world. With the extended peace that we now find ourselves in, we will find that our populace has naturally turned itself to prove useful in this task. Their willingness to collaborate with our administration will prove useful in building a true paradise on earth. For the sake of our own prosperity, we must ensure that twenty years of peace rolls over into fourty."
 cuban_events.5.a: "Perfect"
 cuban_events.6.t: "Fourty Years of Peace"
 cuban_events.6.d: "After forty years of peace, war becomes a distant memory. Generations of our populace have no experience of any warfare and are profoundly grateful for this reason. While the stories of past horror still linger in the minds of the public, they no longer associate them with us. Over this long time they have forgotten our role in creating the last conflict. The new generations raised in the wake of our previous wars have grown even wealthier off the hard work of their ancestors and are looking for new opportunities. The overall population of our nation has also increased, as without war only disease threatens their lives. With the discovery of new opportunities across the waves, many of our realm are looking to find success across the waves. For their sake, we must ensure that forty years of peace rolls over into sixty."
 cuban_events.6.a: "Perfect"
 cuban_events.7.t: "Sixty Years of Peace"
 cuban_events.7.d: "After sixty years of peace our realm has become completely engrossed in the status of peace. It is likely that our throne has changed hands to a ruler who has not known of conflict. As our entire state begins to forget the lessons of warfare, we move towards making the tools of war impossible to reach. The first institution to be cut is the military. With no wars in sight, having such a large peacetime force seems extremely wasteful. The funds would be so much better spent exploring into the new world and enriching our own prosperity. Without the need for war, most of our island’s talented seamen will likely move towards trading along the tides in an attempt to secure their fortune. For their sake, we must ensure that sixty years of peace rolls over into eighty."
 cuban_events.7.a: "Perfect"
 cuban_events.8.t: "Eighty Years of Peace"
 cuban_events.8.d: "After eighty years of peace our realm has reached a sublime height. The memory of war is almost unreachable at this point as most that have witnessed it have died off. Generations have risen and fallen all without bloodshed. This has left our state to become entrenched into the task of improving itself. The generations raised without war become only richer and, by extension, enrich our own pockets through greater taxes. Our volume of trade increases as our former seamen compete to earn their fortune. Even our philosophers and artists have begun to multiply as wealthy patrons throw cash at any man with a theory. For all of them, from the humble trader to the heady philosopher, we must ensure that eighty years of peace rolls over into one hundred."
 cuban_events.8.a: "Perfect"
 cuban_events.9.t: "Pax Cubana"
 cuban_events.9.d: "The Cuban Peace, or Pax Cubana, has left us with intense riches. After one hundred years of peace our nation has ascended above all others in our capacity to prosper. Even the poorest pauper of our realm lives a life fit for a king anywhere else. War has become an indescribable concept at this point, gaining a reputation as a brutish practice of our previously savage state. In our new modern age, there is no need for a standing army or any sort of force. For generations, no conflict has come to this land, why would we waste our riches on a military for an imaginary threat? So much of our state has come prosper under this peace. Only our forefathers have maintained this level of tranquility for so long. For their sake and the rest of humanity, we must ensure that these one hundred years of peace continue until judgment day."
 cuban_events.9.a: "Perfect"
 cuban_events.11.t: "Interrupted Peace"
 cuban_events.11.d: "For whatever reason, our state has become embroiled in war once again. During times like these our military ensures that our citizens remain docile in order to focus solely on victory in conquest. We must quickly defeat whatever foes we have decided to fight against in order to usher back an era of prosperity for our people."
 cuban_events.11.a: "They will have to adapt"
 cuban_events.12.t: "Peace Regained"
 cuban_events.12.d: "Through either our victory or loss to a foe, we have managed to end our bloodshed. Immediately after this conflict it is likely that our citizens will become resistant to our administration and even attempt revolt. Though the future looks tough, we must continue to avoid war to ensure that normalcy is restored once again."
 cuban_events.12.a: "May it last"
 cuban_events.13.t: "Future of our Country"
 cuban_events.13.d: "Throughout the ages, the administration of our forefathers has remained ununified in their focus. In order to ensure that our state experiences the greatest success, it would be prudent to select a single direction for the realm to follow into the future. By opting for peace, we will continue the legacy of our nation’s vow against bloodshed and work towards ensuring prosperity comes to dominate the isle of Cuba. By opting for war, we will work towards claiming total control of the island and bringing the public to accept warfare. The question of whether to break or keep with tradition is a question which every state needs to eventually grapple with, the only question is which side will we fall on?"

 cuban_events.14.t: "Crushing the Resistance"
 cuban_events.14.d: "This morning in the great parliament of Havana, we declared ourselves the supreme dictator of Cuba. Across the country our military occupied statehouses, city squares, and dockyards in order to ensure their compliance. The word spread like wildfire, reaching the ears of every citizen and statesmen of our realm. All now know of our ascendancy and many are dissatisfied. Across the nation they plan to rise up against our glorious rule. In an act of desperation, the various kings of Cuba have attempted to declare independence and restore the soul of our nation. On their part, this will prove to be a profoundly useless endeavor. We must ensure that all are brought to kneel before their new supreme monarch."
 cuban_events.14.a: "Snakes in the Grass!"
 cuban_events.15.t: "Hispaniola Capital"
 cuban_events.15.d: "Our conquest of Hispaniola has brought with it all manner of trouble in its maintenance. An isle so rich such as this one requires precise management and control in order to corral its populace into a manageable state. For this task we require a central base of command on the island, but where to center it? The cities of Port-Au-Prince, Santo Domingo, and Santiago Corazon have served as the historical capital of their respective regions and are suitable places for our administration to rule over the island. Depending on which option we chose, it is likely that its particular region will grow in response. We must consider all of these possibilities and their benefits when choosing a Hispaniolan capital."

 cuban_events.16.t: "Envy of the Tides"
 cuban_events.16.d: "With our success in taming the Antillean trade, we must decide where our focus will lie from here on out. Our domination of the Antillean trade will likely not be permanent, there is just too much trading flowing in from all corners of the globe to ensure that. However, if we were to devote ourselves to a policy of domestic trade we could potentially make this success last. Conversely, the world beyond the waves is just as lucrative as our island’s surroundings. If we were to devote ourselves to a policy of foreign trade we could use our commercial power abroad to influence other nations. Whatever the choice, our prosperity is sure to follow."
