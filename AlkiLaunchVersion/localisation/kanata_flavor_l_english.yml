Travelers from California have brought with them philosophies and arts that surpass anything we have yet to think up. These “classicals” have often heard tales of the bountiful cities of our empire, but have been disappointed by their ruined state. The scars of the civil war and the old administration’s failure have come to haunt us once again. We must ensure that these cities return to their former prosperity in order to accept these new advancements."

Since our nation cannot produce all of the goods that our people need, we must rely on commerce with others in order to succeed. Expanding the capabilities of our trade networks, working with the old companies, and taking key commercial hubs will surely put us in an advantageous position for the future."

The natural resources of our land could be better tapped into through the construction of more sophisticated structures geared towards their exploitation. Mills for our pottery, plantations for our tobacco, and trade stations for our furs would go far in furthering our economy’s efficiency."

Many among our populace have begun to argue about the role our Emperor should serve in the future. The passionate intellectuals of Toronto’s cafes have begun calling for the formation of a parliament or at least a relaxation of our emperor’s rigid rule. Others have argued that our emperor should use their better judgment and absolute power to righteously guide our empire to greatness. Whichever our choice, let it be for the prosperity of the people."
 traversing_the_tropics_title: "Traversing The Tropics"
 traversing_the_tropics_desc: "Our colonial ambitions should not just be restricted to the new world, for there are lands ripe for the taking in the south. Our empire demands a great quantity of spices, however the greedy Cubans jack up the price to gogue our citizens. If we were to establish a closer presence to the Brazilians we could circumvent the Cubans entirely. Colonizing an island in the Eastern Caribbean or some lands in Guyana would no doubt fulfill this need."
 new_ontario_title: "New Ontario"
 new_ontario_desc: "Many of our merchants have taken a key interest in expanding further into the south, specifically taking some of the Filipino isles. Colonizing the region would likely put us into contention with the Brazilian empire, but could allow us to obtain our own source of spices. A collection of these merchants have presented us with the plans for a new trading company in the region which they have branded as the New Ontario Company. Based at the city of Iloilo, this company could allow us to undercut Cuban and Brazilian merchants to sell spices throughout the American continent."

By establishing our presence in New Ontario, we have made great strides in controlling the trade of this region. However, we still are left without a necesarry presence in the western half of the sea. In order to influence this region and expand into the Pacific it would be wise to snag at least one trading port on the Andean peninsula."

 oceanic_entry_desc: "Beyond the waters of the Malaysian sea, the warm tides of the Pacific are foreign to us. Before our explorers had charted this region, they theorized about another great continent which balanced the world. We eventually found that only uninhabited dots float in this great sea. So far no trace has been found of civilization amongst the islands except for several carved stone faces on Headland. Establishing ports on these small islands would allow our vessels to restock and rest during long voyages."

While the tribes of Akilineq are simple nomads, the Victorians have built fabulous cities along the lake that shares their name. While the chiefdoms of Pablonia hunt for their meals, the Victorians sustain massive farms through a sophisticated irrigation system. While the savages of Yoroppa met us with crude spears, the Victorians defended themselves with bronze and iron. Our next objective should be to establish a base on the island in order to trade and plan further expansion."

From what little contact we have shared with the natives, it is exceedingly clear that their lands are full of different rich resources.

 recapturing_bay_trade_title: "Recapturing Bay Trade"
 recapturing_bay_trade_desc: "For centuries our family has sought to tame the wild north of the Hudson Bay. The lucrative possibilities that stem from its many natural gem deposits and plentiful fish first attracted several young Cree chieftains who formed what would eventually evolve into the Hudsonian company. The chieftains established key operations at Attawapiskat and Salluit which eventually flourished into hundreds of coastal fisheries and mining depots. A sophisticated tapestry of different interconnected cities dotted the bay as the company created more opportunities in the north. Their influence came to rival those of the Superior and Acadian companies before their later financial troubles. The network is shattered now amongst different nations, it is our job to reunite it once and for all."

 cashing_out_kanata_desc: "Once the bay had been tamed, the Hudsonian company continued to flourish until the disastrous Greenland campaign. The crazed emperor Pierce Lafayette believed that Peter had spoken to him in a dream to travel to the island and claim the “Eternal Crown of The North.” The Hudsonian company was the only body in the empire which was capable of settling a far off land, so Pierce strong-armed the chieftains to get the job done. Thousands of Canadians perished in the icy north for little to no gains until Pierce cut a deal with the Kyushans to use Floridian slave labor for the settlement. In the end, the Hudsonian company had to sell much of its land to the independent Grandbay republic in order to stay afloat. We must retake this land and ensure that the bay remains whole and prosperous once again."

For centuries the native people of this region have traded with the Canadians, many of them even assisting Peter in constructing his early empire. Some have seen this as a reason for defending the Inuit presence in the arctic, allowing them to continue their existence outside of our evolving empire. These same people would argue for the independence of the Maritimes and the decolonization of Akilineq. It is better to not heed their words as other nations already intend to conquer these lands and make them their own. It is our duty to keep the arctic prosperous and under the reign of the almighty."

However, the region will never truly be united until we hold all of it under our own grasp. The Collectivist and Sacramental taint festers in the soil like a plague, poisoning the wells of justice within every wayward community and frozen lake. It is our divine duty, our divine right, to hold all of the arctic under our control."

 the_plantation_promise_desc: "The riches of this new world are disappointing to say the least. The rumors of gold and gemstones are far overblown and the unruly natives make for poor trading partners. However some of our intrepid settlers have come upon a realization, the soil of this new continent is perfect for growing cash crops. Compared to the other natives of this continent, the natives of yoroppa are more resistant to the pestilence which has quickly spread throughout the land. Conquering these people and using their labor to help us farm these goods could potentially generate more revenue than even the most bountiful of gold mines."

Initially our settlers were surprised by the lack of natives in the region but they soon became fearful as they encountered the cities. Ancient ruins of a dead empire litter the countryside, featuring dense urban streets cluttered with bones and the stench of disease. Luckily, these ruins can provide the basis for our own new colonies. We will carry forward the torch of whatever great civilization made its home here in these forests."

In order to ensure we stay on top, it would be wise for us to plan ahead in our future endeavors. Conquering natives, settling natural ports, and nurturing our colonies should all be our top priorities. Securing this new world does not just mean a larger color on our own maps, but indeed a more prosperous life for our citizens. No longer will we depend on the Cuban for sugar, the Brazilian for pepper, or the Californian for wine. We will be free from the shackles of the infernal Sacramentals and Catholics. The sublime life of the noble will be available to the most common farmer. Together our empire will be a paradise only bested by the heavens above."

However it has managed to attract many settlers due to its connection with a bizarre Islamic sect. Originating before the conquests of Darnay, these traditional Muslims view Iranistan as an ancient holy land. Due to the discrimination they face for denying the revelation of Darnay, they have been quick to leave the homeland in exchange for the frontier. Among the ruins of old tribal cities, these pioneers will scavenge for days to find what they believe are ancient religious artifacts. Whatever their motive, we should make use of their enthusiasm to consolidate the region."

By claiming this city we can force our brothers into exile and resume administration of their empire.

Some of our most intrepid explorers have managed to navigate beyond the endless torrent and reach more land in the east. Landing on these far shores, they planted our flag into the earth and proclaimed the region “Fayettia” after our eternal dynasty.

However, our settlers quickly found that every member of each tribe was covered in this same gold. Brief mining operations have revealed that small shavings of gold are interwoven into the very fabric of this region.

As we colonized further into this continent, we made contact with these seafaring people and enriched ourselves with their knowledge. Their canoes seem to travel impossible distances for their size and carry bountiful holds full of spices. Taking some natural ports closer to their civilization could grant us a key advantage against other colonizers."

However, it is not this imperial legacy which has piqued our minister’s interest in the region. Kiikiwaahk features an ideal climate for the cultivation of many crops which are needed for a quickly growing empire such as ours.

In order to better secure our protection and possibility for expansion, it would be wise to get an official alliance created with the sultan."
 fort_traverse_title: "Fort Traverse"
 fort_traverse_desc: "The city of Traverse was originally founded by one of the many Iowan merchants who flocked to Lake Michigan after the foundation of the Canadian empire. The city was the site of a primitive tribal encampment which was quickly conquered and converted to a small trading port. All that remains of these simpler times are the remanents of the old fort. In its desiccated state, it serves mostly as a ruin rather than any defensive structure. Repairing it could allow us to better protect our state against any invading forces and preserve the legacy of its old use."

 maple_discontent_desc: "It's no secret that the Canadian emperor has a few screws loose. Ever since his disastrous defeat at the city of Chicago, Frederick has become bitter towards the different factions of his nation. On many occasions he has expressed a profound belief that it was due to the inaction of several departments that the eastern campaign was lost, particularly the Maritime navy which was supposed to apply a constant naval pressure throughout Lake Michigan. Frederick’s sour attitude has reflected poorly on his own heir who has become deluded with the same ideas as his father. This has led to a general unpopularity of the royal family and a strong desire for overall change. Perhaps this situation could be of great use to our own nation. Sowing dissent in the right places could push any future conflict into our favor."

In order to regain legitimacy in the eyes of our people we must own these lands and restore the extent of the former empire, yet so much of it lies in the hands of those who just fought alongside us.

Even in the halls of our very capital, Dynastic nobles flaunt their own faith without retribution. The dynastic faith itself is based on a series of local deacons and various denominations with heavy decentralization.

 kanata_events.1.t: "The Maple Throne"
 kanata_events.1.d: "The Maple Throne is an institution almost as old as Canada itself and interwoven with many denominations of the Dynastic faith. The holds a divine and political legitimacy which recognizes the collective right of the people to oust any corrupted heir of the disciple Peter. Over time, the institution has slowly evolved into a powerful check on the emperor embedded into the Canadian concious. With our ascension to the Canadian throne we are now placed into the awkward position of either recognizing ourselves as the continuation of this ancient legacy or abolishing it outright. Whichever choice we decide upon will likely guide the future direction of our state. The former decision will move us towards restoring the empire of our ancestors in The Great Lakes through a large network of tributaries while the latter would have us seek a new path forward. Abolishing the institution would no doubt destabilize our state in the present, but could provide a more stable rule in the long run. Conversely, embracing our spot on the throne could grant us powerful overreach when we need it most."

Luckily, our brothers and sisters of the faith will have no qualms about our religion due to their shared belief. Our ministers advise us that if we were to reach out to these different nations many would likely join our cause. However they also have stated that it is unlikely that sufficiently large nations would wish to become a subject. No matter what the response it is likely that a few nations would acquiesce, thus expanding our foreign presence and tightening our grip on the Maple Throne."

Founded by nobles in an attempt to sure up the Hudson bay trade, they now are in a state of decline with the chaos of our empire’s current state. This decline has left their company devalued and ripe for purchasing. With only a handful of ducats we could possibly secure a powerful foothold in the Hudson Bay. Of course, there is always the potential that they could decline this offer which would force us into the unenviable position of conflict."

If we were to accept this offer, we would lose our total autonomy, becoming entirely under their state. Conversely, if we were to decline this offer we would likely become a victim to their army.

Nearly 400 nobles of the nation arrived in the city for the occasion. Of course their answer was clear: a resounding yes. In the chambers of the noble parliament, our dear emperor shook hands with each council member before finally declaring the merger completed. Today’s deal will truly be one for the history books."

Our ministers immediately began drafting up plans for a response and agreed that the council’s flagrant rejection could be used as a means for war."

In its current state it poses a powerful asset to us through the many gem and fur resources kept within its borders. Despite this, many of our own ministers have already begun drafting up plans for the region’s designation as a tributary state. In its current form, the arctic is governed under the Nunistan department, one of the many regions of our empire that finds itself in between full statehood or territory status. The department status has been a state of limbo for the regional government as they are prevented from involving themselves in national matters. If we were to grant them a higher level of legitimacy, we would certainly be able to exploit our status as heirs to The Maple Throne. Conversely, if we were to keep the arctic as is we would continue to tap into its lucrative natural resources."

 kanata_events.10.d: "The Enlightenment movement, from wherever it has spread, has come to dominate the intellectual conversions of our country’s burgeoning middle class. This is mostly due to the fact that enlightenment principles were woven into our country’s founding with the Maple Throne doctrine. Specifically, the Maple Throne’s ability to act as a powerful check on the emperor’s rule by the people demonstrated a balance of powers only presented in some of the most democratic republics. In our current times the theories of statecraft centralize entirely around the role of the emperor in this position. Is it the emperor’s job to rule on all matters of the state through his absolute power to prevent factionalism of the public, or is it his job to enact the public’s will through the medium of a powerful parliament? The debate of this topic has reached a fever pitch with many of our own ministers becoming embroiled in picking sides. For the good of our nation it is now necessary that we pick a side and work towards that aim."

For this reason, Arborea is particularly pliable to conversion due to centuries of subjugation. Our own decisions in this region could help to define how the rest of the world perceives our religious policy. By forcibly converting the region, we follow the empires that conquered the region before us. By accepting the Arboreans no matter their faith we signal to other nations our distinction from the empires of old. Further, accepting the Arboreans would work towards improving relations with other faiths throughout our empire."

When Jaxon was originally exiled from being the chosen heir for the Canadian empire all those years ago, he was given reign over the city state of Traverse on the isle of Michigan. As part of this position he was forced to become a tributary state of the Canadian Empire, but was ostensibly granted independence in his rule. If we were to call upon this same clause and export one of our unfortunate cousins to that dreaded post in Michigan, we could gain yet another tributary as part of our network in the form of Traverse."

 kanata_events.13.d: "Our reclamation of the Maritimes presents us with an interesting opportunity for corralling the bay trade. After Pierce’s conquest of the Saint Lawrence Gulf from the Ainu, the emperor selected the city of Halifax as the designated Maritime port of the region. At first this role seemed rather useless, as most goods flowed into the empire from the Great Lakes in the west. However, as interest continues to rise in possible lands across the seas and the rising powers of Japan, a designated Maritime port may bring a powerful use. Our ministers have presented three options: Halifax, St.John’s, and Happy Valley-Goose. Halifax is the most developed of the three which carries with it both positives and negatives. While the city does have the infrastructure to support high trade volume, it also has little room to grow given its already developed status. Conversely Happy Valley-Goose is underdeveloped and further away from most general trading ports, but could be made more prominent if trade in the Hudson bay were to flourish. Finally, St.John serves as an intermediate choice. Not directly in the line of most common trade routes and lightly developed, the city could serve as the perfect place to make our own unique trading center."
