 louisian_affairs_title: "Louisian Affairs"
 louisian_affairs_desc: "Our own crisis here in Texas is felt in the surrounding nations as many of our own citizens flee across the borders to escape the looming threat of collapse. No where can this be better felt than in Louisiana, which has become just as anxious of our apparently inevitable fall. Louisiana is now dominated by three nations, the recently united Lord’s League of Magnolia, the Dukedom of Acadiana, and the Republic of New Orleans. In a unique move, we could try and press our own historical status as Louisiana’s protector to subjugate one of these nations. It would be risky, but desperate times call for desperate measures."
 texans_in_the_bayou_title: "Texans In The Bayou"
 texans_in_the_bayou_desc: "Louisiana was one of the few Catholic nations present in Africa before the northern crusades. Merchants from Veracruz had attempted to create a number of different republics in the Caribbean, Florida, and Africa in order to undercut domestic merchants. However, not a single republic managed to survive for long, as nearby states would either invade or embargo the meek nations. In one of these attempts, the Nikpech merchant clan hired a series of mercenaries to take the city of New Orleans. The city was besieged and captured by the mercenaries who quickly betrayed and slaughtered the Nikpechs as well. With one of the most lucrative natural ports on the Mexican continent, these mercenaries united the lands of Louisiana and converted them to their native Catholic faith."
 alexandria_whole_title: "Alexandria Whole"
 alexandria_whole_desc: "One of the greatest failures of our predecessors was their inability to conquer all of Alexandria. Off the backs of the Italian crusade, crossing the Alabaman strait seemed to be an easy affair. Yet, the Alexandrians managed to prevent the combined might of Africa from taking the city of Cairo with their small coalition. This embarrassment and the following counteroffensive encouraged many crusader companies to disband and retire. We must correct this great mistake, not only for its historical legitimacy, but also for the region’s valuable natural resources. Florida’s cotton is renowned throughout the American and Mexican continents due to its high quality. Using their techniques on our own cotton production could give us a corner on the market."
 the_riverside_revolt_title: "The Riverside Revolt"
 the_riverside_revolt_desc: "The stimulus for the Cansanciato was the Riverside Rebellion. For centuries, the Texan empire had peacefully split with previous states after the crusades. The Arizonian, Italian, Sonoran, and Louisian partitions all came without bloodshed. However, when the Riverlords of the Rio Grande attempted to get their own independence, they did so in the most bloodthirsty way possible. A surprise revolution turned into a decade long conflict which exacerbated a minor economic decline into the Cansanciato. Now the Riverlords relax getting fat off of their greed. Their land is truthfully ours, we just need the strength to press our claims."
 reclaiming_the_river_title: "Reclaiming the River"
 reclaiming_the_river_desc: "The first revolutionaries sprouted up around El Paso and Laredo. They were heavily supported by Coahuilan mercenaries and many of our finest generals. The Riverside Rebellion was a shameful display of our state’s former complacency. The inability to crush a simple civil revolt led to the razing of Austin and the loss of almost half of our country’s territory. Through whatever stroke of luck, we have been granted the opportunity to undo their actions and reclaim our former status. By retaking these lands, we can squash the final signs of our forefather’s failure and once again display our divinely granted might."
 tampering_in_tamaulipas_title: "Tampering In Tamaulipas"
 tampering_in_tamaulipas_desc: "Among the more conspiracy minded men of our empire, the blame for the Riverside Rebellion lies in the hands of the Empresians more than any other. Many of the Riverlords who split with our nation after the rebellion opted to privatize their state and join the company network. Much of Rio Grande’s army was composed of Empresian mercenaries subsidized by Empresian loans. Whatever their involvement, the territories of Tamaulipas and Coahuila are the next step in our conquest."
 containing_coahuila_title: "Containing Coahuila"
 containing_coahuila_desc: "Before the northern crusades, the territories of Tamaulipas and Coahuila were controlled by the Maderian Horde. The combined lords of Empresia had a keen interest in reclaiming their homelands, as the descendants of Matthew had forced them to flee south four centuries before. These Empresian lords called upon the service of several different crusader companies in order to retake these lands. Out of the companies, the Taxco Band would become supremely important as the founders of the Texan Empire. The Taxco band was originally set to take only the territory of Coahuila, but went beyond in the name of glory and The Lord. From Monclova to Austin the band’s director, Luis Bravopan, led a brilliant campaign that dismantled Patriotic hordes. The warpath of our ancestors now stands before us, let us claim a little glory for ourselves."
 secure_protection_texas_title: "Secure Protection"
 secure_protection_texas_desc: "The Cansanciato has severely hindered our diplomatic presence. Most Catholic nations view us as a failed state, ready to collapse at a moment’s notice. Many of our diplomatic missions have been outright refused and his eminence has not visited the region in decades. Our quickly slipping economy compounded with this lack of work has led many diplomats to leave their post in resignation. We must act quickly to secure allies and regain the trust of our nation's most skilled statesmen."
 enforce_hegemony_texas_title: "Enforce Hegemony"
 enforce_hegemony_texas_desc: "The hour of our recovery has finally arrived. With a revived and loyal military, our advisors have created a plan for the reclamation of our country’s land. The recent purge of our country’s top military commanders has spooked the rest of the crusader class. For the first time in nearly a century, we will be able to tax territory and dictate trade. Getting this land into imperial hands will go far in improving our economy, administrative competency, and foreign reputation. This action will heavily destabilize our country, but is the necessary first step towards its recovery."
 stomp_out_corruption_title: "Stomp Out Corruption"
 stomp_out_corruption_desc: "We have butchered the resistant legacy generals, taken back control of our territory, and started the path towards solvency, yet there is still one problem which plagues the corners of our government: corruption. From the farmer who bribes his local lord to the Eyearess who skims some off the top, every aspect of our state operates at a seedy level. While we can act now to stop the increase in this corruption, eliminating their networks of lies will take generations."
 restore_texan_glory_title: "Restore Texan Glory"
 restore_texan_glory_desc: "Our administration has managed to navigate one of the most dire crises ever presented to an empire. From the brink of destruction, we have managed to reform our military, revive our economy, reinvigorate our intellectuals, and reshuffle our bureaucracy. Yet, our peers in Africa have not noticed our changes. They still believe us to be the weak nation which they could have so easily pushed around years ago. We must reclaim our position as a great power on the world stage, then it will become clear again."
 consolidate_texas_title: "Consolidate Texas"
 consolidate_texas_desc: "Despite our best efforts, we have lost some of our territory to surrounding kingdoms. In our moment of greatest weakness, our neighbors exploited our misfortune and committed a grave evil. We have not forgotten this misdeed, neither have the swords of our soldiers. We must ready ourselves, from Santa Fe to Houston, Texas is to be whole once again! From our newly united territory we will strike at those who wronged us. Let the nations of this world tremble, for the great beast of Africa has reawoken."
 nuevo_mexico_title: "Nuevo Mexico"
 nuevo_mexico_desc: "The city of Albuquerque is supremely important for its historical status and commercial dominance. The city was the capital of the mighty Monroevian horde which reigned over much of Africa before the Northern Crusades. Taking the city became an obsession for much of the Northern Crusade, as it also served as a unique holy site for many Patriotic denominations. The eventual battle for the city was uneventful, as internal conditions in the Monroevian horde had left the city destitute and defenseless. For our own purposes, the city of Albuquerque holds massive sway over the Argelino trade node. Claiming it, and the rest of New Mexico, would enrich us greatly and provide a path for further eastern expansion."
 assassin_of_arizonia_title: "Assassin of Arizona"
 assassin_of_arizonia_desc: "When the crusades calmed from their fever pitch, the Texan empire stood as an entity too large to manage itself. In a series of diplomatic partitions, the empire gave away territory to several states. Among the largest of these partitions was the Arizonian Accord. The Arizonian state was given control of lands from Phoenix to Roswell. This effectively cut the Texan empire in half, with both halves retaining heavy diplomatic ties. Over the following centuries, their positive relations collapsed as the subsequent Texan emperors attempted to claw back more territory. Our ancestors made a grave mistake in throwing away their gifts from the lord, it is our job to regain them once again."
 silencing_sonora_title: "Silencing Sonora"
 silencing_sonora_desc: "The Sonoran accords were one of the first partitions of our empire. The region was truly unique in its identity, as El Norte was sparsely populated before the arrival of the crusaders. The land was given out plentifully after the defeat of the Monroevian horde, and many crusaders used their pillaged wealth to improve the region into a more liveable state. This tie to the land created a unique identity which quickly led to cries for independence. Whatever their supposed status, the lands of Sonora were once part of our empire. It would do them well to join it again."
 crushing_chihuahua_title: "Crushing Chihuahua"
 crushing_chihuahua_desc: "Chihuahua is the last roadblock in our path towards uniting El Norte. After the Sonoran accords, the Chihuahuan accords further split our territory in the region. The decision to release this territory was controversial among the Texan nobles of the time, as it was the site of a bitter religious conflict. The city of Chihuahua was the holy sea for the Antipope, a man who claimed to be the true successor to the line of Tepeyac. The skirmishes in the city had escalated to all out violence when the accords were signed. Quickly after its independence, Chihuahua was invaded by a coalition of nations which squashed their heretical thoughts. To regain full control of El Norte, we must bring this wayward territory back home."
 africa_united_title: "Africa United"
 africa_united_desc: "In antiquity, the region now known as Africa was simply referred to as Texas. The name Africa originated from the false prophet Jesus of the Salt Lake, whose sacramental faith never took hold in Mexico. Despite its heretical origins, the name has stuck with those in the Catholic world. We have done well to overcome our circumstances and thrive in the aftermath, but the work is not yet done. The lands of Africa must be made whole once again if we are to be forever cemented into the history books. This, just like all other tasks, will prove trivial with The Almighty at our backs."
 into_the_breach_title: "Into The Breach"
 into_the_breach_desc: "Our nation has been wracked with a series of problems so great that many have wondered if we will ever recover. The fear of an imminent collapse has led many to pull back their involvement in most Texan affairs. Of more recent consequence, many merchants have begun to seek involvement outside of the Alabaman sea, favoring more stable opportunities in the Antilles and Veracruz. If we are to recover from this dire situation, a good first step would be to attract some merchants back to our nation."
 dictating_markets_texas_title: "Dictating Markets"
 dictating_markets_texas_desc: "Now that we have acquired some protection and regained our merchant’s faith we must work towards regaining economic independence. This task is vital for our nation, as without money we cannot fund our military. A poorly funded military leaves us open to attack and revolt from those we are indebted to. Any learned man knows that there is only one solution to financial woes: mercantilism. By promoting the hoarding of wealth and protecting domestic trade we can hope to alleviate internal fears of economic collapse. While our own royal budget may be collapsing, it is important that the common burgher does not feel the pain of our forefather’s misdeeds."
 death_and_taxes_texas_title: "Death And Taxes"
 death_and_taxes_texas_desc: "Now that we have fooled the commoners into thinking the economy is recovering, we must now work on preventing total collapse. In order to prevent any sort of domestic disaster, whether it be a coup, religious uprising, or seperatist rebellion, we will need to fill imperial coffers. The problem is that most of our territory is privately farmed for taxes and, by extension, unreachable for our own uses. Almost all of the plans to remedy this situation require a minimum level of national stability, so that should be our next step."
 copy_what_works_texas_title: "Copy What Works"
 copy_what_works_texas_desc: "Despite our best efforts, the economy refuses to recover entirely. In situations such as these, it is wise to look towards other successful states and copy their good practices. When the great Monrovian horde faced economic ruin during their invasion into Empresia, the supreme director drafted nobles of his court into the administration as special ministers known as Eyearess. The uncles, cousins, and aunts of the director would be shipped throughout the empire to specially collect taxes for the royal family with an expansive set of servants. Our status as Monroevia’s successor has led to a continuation of this title, yet the Eyearesses have become complacent. It would do us well to replace this hereditary system with a more meritocratic one like those in the Oaxacan or Cuban state."
 total_solvency_title: "Total Solvency"
 total_solvency_desc: "Our economy now shows sure signs of recovery, we must nurture it to its full growth. Our advisors have set the five ducat income balance as a benchmark for when further spending can responsibly be continued. As well, it would be wise to carry an imperial stockpile for future rainy days and wars. As it stands, we have not just saved our country from total economic collapse, but likely all of Africa. Once our nation regains its status, it is likely that investors from abroad will attempt to further accelerate the economy in order to improve the value of their own assets in the empire."
 spirit_of_santa_ana_title: "Spirit of Santa Ana"
 spirit_of_santa_ana_desc: "Lucas III de Santa Anna was the architect of the Italian crusade. While Diego VIII might have called upon the Catholic world to invade, Lucas planned the points of attack and managed the different crusading companies. Through leveraging his status as a respectable general of the Uintah crusade, Lucas managed to command a level of cohesion across the ranks and created an airtight offensive against the combined Sacramental forces. One of his most masterful maneuvers was his conquest of Sicily, in which pulled off simultaneous landings at Pampa, Perryton, and Dalhart. The first step to reigniting the Italian crusade would be to follow in his footsteps and claim Sicily as our own."
 approaching_eden_title: "Approaching Eden"
 approaching_eden_desc: "The Italian crusade was a profound success during its time. The forces of the Sacramental coalition were scattered and the whole peninsula was put under the Texan empire. The local populace was incredibly resistant to the foreign occupation which necessitated the Texan army to stay in the region. Despite occupying the territory for a century, little progress was made in converting or taming the locals. By the time of the Italian partition, the state was already beginning to crumble. We must learn from this history to ensure that Italy forever remains in Catholic hands."
 righting_the_wrong_title: "Righting the Wrong"
 righting_the_wrong_desc: "Our crusade for Italy now reaches its logical conclusion: total domination. Even the old kingdom of Italy only reached Florence. The main focus of the crusade was to take the holy city of Rome. Supposedly, the lost ancient line of Popes originated from this city. By recovering Rome, Mexico became filled with His grace. Now that it has fallen out of our grasp, look towards the world. Heresy spreads throughout the continent and there are whispers of reformation. We must take back the city or face the consequences that come with straying from His light."
 rome_restored_title: "Rome Restored"
 rome_restored_desc: "We have done well to unite the lands of Italy, but there is still so much to do. Many in the region still cling to the old Heresy of Venus, we must ensure that they are guided to the faith. Just the same, the city of Rome lies in a state of disrepair. The constant warring for its splendor has tarnished its walls and markets. Repairing this city and enforcing the word of The Lord will ensure that we forever leave our mark on Italy."
 the_partisan_threat_title: "The Partisan Threat"
 the_partisan_threat_desc: "There is a tarnish on this beautiful continent of ours. During the Northern Crusades, the cowards of Baja signed a deal with the devil of Francisco to become part of their unholy union. Ever since this pact, the Partisans have crawled around our continent like ants. At one time, our ancestors managed to conquer much of the land before it slipped back into heretical control. Our path of conquest has led us straight to their doorstep. This time, we will ensure that they will never recover."
 across_the_colorado_title: "Across the Colorado"
 across_the_colorado_desc: "Crusading Baja has become a time honored tradition for Catholics. The first crusade for Baja was a failure, as Bajio conquers were blown off course on their way to the Cabos. The second attempt came during the rush towards Albuquerque, which saw success as the crusaders managed to take Loreto and Mulege. This spooked the Bajans into joining the empire who then promptly repelled the brave crusaders. Since this time, four more invasions have been attempted with differing amounts of success. It is our turn to take part in this tradition, pray it goes better than the previous tries."
 send_them_packing_title: "Send Them Packing"
 send_them_packing_desc: "Our conquest of the north was a great success, now it is time to finally purge this scum from the continent. As we continue to dismantle the Partisan threat, the emperor of their union loses more and more of his legitimacy. His embarrassment is a well deserved fate, as his kin were heavily resistant to our crusades for Italy and Uintah. Our men are already preparing for the final stretch. From Colorado to Panama, Mexico will finally be in only Catholic hands."
 union_busting_title: "Union Busting"
 union_busting_desc: "Now that we have united Baja, the opportunity presents itself to finally abolish the heretical Californian Union. The union holds its origins in antiquity. Before Jesus of the Salt Lake, the Californians had turned their warlike tribes into democratic city state. Through the ages, the region has served as home to the most advanced civilization on the American continent. Now the empire is a bed of corruption of religious strife. It is our job to finally liberate California from its state of union."
 baja_bay_breeze_title: "Baja Bay Breeze"
 baja_bay_breeze_desc: "Sinaloa is a peculiar portion of Empresia. It is the poorest part of the network despite holding its valuable pacific coastline. This can mostly be attributed to its relation to Baja. Sinaloa trades primarily with the Union of California, which does not share the same appreciation for free trade as most of the Catholic world. Taking the area will help us to better consolidate Baja Bay and put us on the path towards conquering the rest of the companies."
 dunking_on_durango_title: "Dunking on Durango"
 dunking_on_durango_desc: "Durango is a bizzare city. The most successful capitalists of the Empresian network flock to the city right before their death in order to commission the creation of towering decorated stone spires. The tradition was originally started by the first president of the Durangan company, who had a small stone spire placed next to his grave. His son, in an attempt to oneup his father, built a larger spire next to his grave. Even now, as our armies approach the border of Durango, the spires seem to stretch into the heavens. It is our duty to end their fruitless competition and finally claim all of Empresia as our own."
 temporary_solution_texas_title: "Temporary Solution"
 temporary_solution_texas_desc: "The Texan army used to be feared throughout the world, now it lies in a sad state of disrepair. Ever since the crusades, we have relied upon crusading companies to fill the nation’s military. Under the rule of Theodore Galveston, Antonio’s father, the Texan state established a national army. This move heavily upset the crusading companies who happened to own most of the country’s land. The few untalented soldiers that managed to find their way into the Texan army were slaughtered trying to put down the Riverside Rebellion. This series of setbacks has given the Texan military a deadly reputation, a reputation so bad that most men flee the country when they are called to serve. In order to unshackle ourselves from this reputation we must regain the public’s faith through training the military and avoiding losing lives."
 paying_whats_due_texas_title: "Paying What's Due"
 paying_whats_due_texas_desc: "There is a haze in the barracks, the fortresses, and encampments of our great nation. This haze has led to carelessness and disorganization amongst even the most trained of our armed forces. This haze comes from the deep debt owed to a large portion of our current military and the belief that the empire will not be able to make good on their payments. Many men who joined the army to suppress the Riverside Rebellion were promised money to be paid after the revolt, but the cash never came. It is now our job to make good on these promises and ensure that the army regains their composure."
 purge_the_generals_title: "Purge The Generals"
 purge_the_generals_desc: "The greatest threat to our survival through these dire times is the asmassing crowd of disloyal military commanders who are resistant to our reform. The status quo of our nation benefits these commanders as their forefathers were granted vast swaths of land in lieu of payment for their military service. The inevitable result of our actions in fixing this nation will be their downfall. When presented with a drastic consequence such as this, it is likely that these commanders will plan some drastic countermeasure. We must act decisively to make sure that they are not able to pull off their plot."
 regain_war_enthusiasm_texas_title: "Regain War Enthusiasm"
 regain_war_enthusiasm_texas_desc: "For the last few centuries, our military has been bogged down by a series of domestic revolutions and civil conflicts. Our nation is in need of a victory, now more than ever. Fabricating a claim, pressing a rivalry, or escalating a trade conflict could refill the spirit of this nation’s weary populace and demonstrate our acedency to the kingdoms of Mexico."
 revive_the_waco_docks_title: "Revive The Waco Docks"
 revive_the_waco_docks_desc: "When Pope David IV summoned the crusade for Uintah, he traveled to the city of Waco to help organize the journey. When his successor summoned the crusade for Italy, he yet again traveled to Waco to use their docks. Waco has long been the capital of our nation’s navy, yet it has fallen into a state of disrepair after the Cansanciato. We must work to revive the shipyard and promote its development if we are to attempt any invasion across the Middle Seas."
 prepare_a_crusader_fleet_title: "Prepare A Crusader Fleet"
 prepare_a_crusader_fleet_desc: "Out of the three major crusades undertaken by our loyal Catholics against the Sacramental threat, the crusade for Uintah was the greatest failure. A stain on our otherwise successful record, the Battle of Delicate Arch saw the brutal slaughter of the African coalition. In order to avenge this we must strike at the Sacramentals once again. To cross the Middle Seas with an army large enough to accomplish this task, we will need a sizable fleet."
 heresey_of_venus_title: "Heresy of Venus"
 heresey_of_venus_desc: "When Jesus of the Salt Lake preached his heretical message to the world, he forever changed the American continent. Before his vile words spread, a large portion of the continent followed a faith similar to our own. His faith, the Sacramental faith, has since been branded by the Catholic church as the Heresy of Venus due to its connection to the red demon Venus. It is important to remember why we fight against the Sacramentals, for they are blinded by the devil’s depiction. We must bring them to the light before it is too late."
 securing_uintah_holdings_title: "Securing Uintah"
 securing_uintah_holdings_desc: "Our success in Uintah has been secured. We have succeeded where our ancestors failed, yet there is still more work to be done. As long as the Sacramentals hold their grip over the continent, they will attempt to kick us off. We must secure our position to ensure that they cannot simply undo our hard work after a generation. Moving to take Bluffs and portions of Andalucia will help to cement our position."
 false_prophets_title: "False Prophets"
 false_prophets_desc: "The capital of the Sacramental faith, the place from which their false prophet emerged, is Salt Lake City. Our conquests into Uintah and the rest of Utah have been divinely ordained. The true purpose of this crusade is not to expand our borders or convert the heathens, but instead to shatter the very capital of their heresy. Come now all ye faithful, ready yourself with musket and saber. It is the hour of The Lord and these devils will fall before his grace! ¡Dios lo quiere!"
 rebuild_pearland_title: "Rebuild Pearland"
 rebuild_pearland_desc: "The intellectual capital of Mexico during the medieval era was the illustrious city of Pearland. The city drew most of its talent from the aging crusaders who were well traveled by the end of their respective campaigns. With their worldly knowledge, these crusaders created different guilds to further study into the subjects of mathematics, philosophy, and the arts. Pearland quickly became a place for ambitious scholars to prove their theories with many rich patrons flocking to the city. However, as our empire has continued its slow decline, many of these scholars have fled to more prosperous horizons. The first step towards regaining these lost minds would be to invest in the city’s development."
 attract_intellectuals_title: "Attract Intellectuals"
 attract_intellectuals_desc: "We must attract more intellectuals to reinvigorate our country’s appreciation for the sciences and arts. During the height of our empire’s prosperity, we mastered the studies of alchemies and mathematics. The great calculator John Seton was renowned for his various inventions and advancements in his field. Seton’s greatest accomplishment was the creation of a large clockwork device which computed sums and products using a set of interlocking gears, wheels, and cylindars. Tragically, the device was destroyed in a great fire which leveled large portions of Pearland in the early 15th century. There are thousands of men like Seton throughout this great continent, it is our job to seek them out and give them the tools for their sucess."
 texan_enginuity_title: "Texan Enginuity"
 texan_enginuity_desc: "Our empire’s engenuity must be allowed to prosper in order to complete our recovery. During the crusades, the Texan emperor would hire scores of talented intellectuals to travel with him to the front in order to better plan out his attacks. Alchemists, cartographers, and philosophers would all give their own unique input into the plan of attack. As would be expected, this was an incredibly useless practice that often led to more confusion and less decisive action. Nonetheless, keeping close royal advisors to assist in matters of the state always helps."
 classicalism_texas_title: "Classicalism"
 classicalism_texas_desc: "From San Joaquin, a new movement of art and science has reached our borders. Embracing this new institution is just another one of the steps towards total recovery. The glut of talent that has now spread across the continent could also provide us with utility in expanding our own urban infrastructure. Making use of these new architectural advancements would make our capital a truly Classical city."
 restoring_houston_title: "Restoring Houston"
 restoring_houston_desc: "The great city of Houston wasn’t always the capital of Texas. The first Texan nation, founded by Luis Bravopan, held its capital at the city of Austin. Soon after the fall of the Monroevian horde, the new Texan state moved its capital to the former Monroevian capital at Albuquerque. From Albuquerque the capital was quickly moved to the more permanent San Antonio, where it stayed for nearly 3 centuries until the rise of the Galvestons. Through the Cansanciato, Houston has been left straggling behind the other glorious cities of Mexico. We must work to ensure that Houston fits as the capital of our glorious empire."
 stock_pearland_university_title: "Stock Pearland University"
 stock_pearland_university_desc: "Pearland’s university grounds are thriving for the first time in nearly a century. While the Cansanciato managed to heavily damage our intellectual reputation, our measures taken in recovery have worked to attract great talent. With such a great pool of academics at our fingertips, it would be wise to draft some of them into our own imperial ranks. Having such educated advisors could make aspects of administering the state much easier."
 alabaman_dominence_title: "Alabaman Dominence"
 alabaman_dominence_desc: "The Alabaman strait stands as one of the most important waterways in the world. The ships which float on its tides carry goods to both Canadian emperor and Californian elector alike. Dominating this trade route is becoming even more important in this age of Globalization. The discovery of the new world has increased the importance of the Caribbean as Cuban Pablonia brings in valuable Salt, Gold, and Ivory. We must move to secure the strait, to increase our own influence at home and abroad."
 industrial_capacity_title: "Industrial Capacity"
 industrial_capacity_desc: "We are truly living in an age of wonders. The advent of manufactures and increasing specialization of resources could allow us to more fully exploit our environment. Just as we adopted advances in order to weather the Cansanciato, it would be wise to adopt these new advances to help our economy survive whatever challenges the world might throw at it. Across the countryside, the buzz of plantations and mills will spell success for our coffers."

 texan_events.1.t: "La Cansanciato"
 texan_events.1.d: "For decades, our nation has been in the midst of a great crisis which could eventually spell our demise. The Texan Empire was founded in the wake of the crusades, a set of religious conflicts which dominated the Mexican and American continents during the middle ages. During these conflicts, thousands of Texans fought bravely in order to purge the heresy of the Sacramentals and Partisans. For their services, many were granted vast swaths of land throughout our empire in lieu of currency. While this system initially provided stability, it has now come to be a burden on the state. A great famine in the middle of the 14th century saw our emperor expend most of the imperial treasury on fighting the crisis. In a move to refill the royal coffers, Theodore Galveston levied an estate tax which met fierce resistance from the entrenched crusader class. This resistance, coupled with a large-scale revolt along the Rio Grande, sparked the beginning of the Cansanciato. The imperial bureaucracy has become corrupt and complacent as the country begins to spiral into ruin. Traders have begun to flee the country in an attempt to seek more lucrative and stable horizons. This has led to a sharp decrease in agricultural outputs and production as the empire proves unable to ferry goods across the countryside. The army continues to be a national embarrassment ever since its defeat at the hands of Rio Grande as many of the highest ranking generals consider the possibility of a coup. It is now up to Theodore’s son, Antonio Galveston, to prevent the total collapse of his nation and revive the former glory of the Texan Empire."

 texan_events.3.t: "The Big Bluff"
 texan_events.3.d: "The worst has come to pass. Our generals have made the decision to abandon our state. With them, all of our empire’s military talent has left the country. Thousands of soldiers and their families crossed into the borders of the neighboring kingdoms in an attempt to escape our apparent collapse. By their lead, thousands of the crusader class have also started to flee our state into the rest of the continent. Not only has this exacerbated our terrible situation, but also led to a myriad of new problems. Many of our neighbors have now begun laying claim to our territory due to our status as a “failed state.” With the help of our most talented military generals, there is no doubt that they will have a keen knowledge of our weaknesses. In order to survive these troubling times, we will need a significant miracle. If we were to infiltrate these states and purge the generals which betrayed us, we could finally recover from this disastrous affair. As it stands, we are left defenseless and surrounded by bloodthirsty nations. May the Lord preserve us."

 texan_events.4.d: "In a miracle from the heavens above, we have managed to recover from this crisis. By finally snuffing out the last sources of resistance abroad we can ensure that our neighbors will not have an unfair advantage against our state in warfare. Sadly, this victory does not overcome the rest of our problems, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. During this crisis we have managed to build a significant force of loyal military advisors in our state to replace the old ones. There is still much work to do in repairing our state, our economy is still in ruins and our bloodthirsty neighbors still lay claim to our empire, yet for this moment we can celebrate our victory against all odds."
 texan_events.4.a: "Glory for Texas!"
 texan_events.5.t: "Reaching Solvency"
 texan_events.5.d: "A crowd of ministers approached with a proposal to temporarily solve our economic woes. In our empire, the right to farm taxes on a set of land is typically reserved for a class of loyal bureaucrats known as the Eyearess. However, after the Louisianian crusade, several members of the crusader class who had already settled down in the empire took the ability to farm taxes on their own estate in lieu of the standard compensation. This worked to lighten the burden of paying the large coalition needed to defeat the Alexandrians, however it began to pose problems as the royal coffers lightened up. The tax farming title was hereditary, meaning that successive generations would continue to collect taxes on their own land and take a large cut for their troubles. In order to temporarily inject a large amount of funds into the imperial treasury, our ministers have proposed a one-time tax on second generation landowners. This would certainly have to be collected quickly and could cause some heavy instability for our country, but we need money now more than ever. On the other hand, making a public display out of this proposal and rejecting it could go far in improving the crusader class’s opinion of our administration. During times like these, either option could prove invaluable to helping our empire survive."

 texan_events.6.t: "Louisian Involvement"
 texan_events.6.d: "Louisiana has relied upon our empire for its protection ever since it broke from our borders during the Orleans accord. This status has always been of mutual benefit. With their independence secured, the Louisianians could focus on improving their trade and our nation could benefit off of the runoff. However, with our nation’s decline, Louisiana has begun to falter in their agreement. Our ally in the region could prove a useful asset if we are to assert our status, it just matters how. The most direct action we could take is to press the nation into vassalization, which would be difficult to maintain given our nation’s current status. Alternatively, we could envelop them into a personal union, adding them to the Galveston family. Finally, we could opt for a more long term route. Keeping our ally at a distance, we could wait to fully annex them after assisting their conquests of Louisiana. Whatever the choice, this opportunity presents us with the unique chance to state our influence on the world stage in a time when we need it the most."

 texan_events.7.t: "Unity Under The Houstonites"
 texan_events.7.d: "Africano culture is especially unique for its origins. It borrows tradition from the people who lived on the subcontinent throughout the centuries. Originally Africa was inhabited by the original Texans who were quickly conquered and displaced by Matthew and his army. The influence of the Utahn culture melded with the Texans and created its own unique blend over the centuries. Then, when the Mexicans of the south engaged in their crusade north, the Africano culture added many elements of Anahuac and Bajio culture. When the Texan empire was first founded, it was ruled mostly by the Texano elites from Austin and the Argelino nobles from Albuquerque. Slowly, over the generations, the Houstonite people of Galveston rose through the ranks to become dominant. In our journey to ease the Cansanciato and reunite our lost territory, we have spread the Houstonite way of life throughout the empire. It is through the tenacity of our people that we have risen to this sublime height and, god willing, it is through their continued rule that we will reach even greater victories."

 texan_events.8.t: "Legacy Of The Revolt"
 texan_events.8.d: "The Riverside Revolt was a bloodbath for the brave army of Texas. Traditionally, our empire had relied upon the various crusading bands in order to survive, but once the crusades came to a close these bands mostly fell out of use. The imperial Texan army was vastly expanded in order to fill the niche these crusaders held. When the Riverlords decided to spring their devilish plot, it was up to the Texan crusaders to go forth and crush the resistance. However, the army was mostly inexperienced and unorganized compared to the battle hardened Empresian mercenaries and was quickly slaughtered. Despite a severe numerical advantage on our side, the Riverside Revolt saw our total defeat. Yet, this does not need to be how it is remembered. History is written by the victors, and seeing as we have reclaimed our lands it is now our chance to remember the fallen in better terms. Many of our ministers have suggested a monument be constructed to commemorate the event, which aspect of our soldiers should it focus on?"

 texan_events.9.t: "The African Empire Of Old"
 texan_events.9.d: "Claiming the title of Africa is a controversial decision. The origins of the term come from the false shepherd of the Salt Lake who instructed his disciple Matthew to unite the region under the Sacramental banner. Matthew was successful, for a period of time, yet the African empire of old eventually collapsed when different Patriotic mercenaries split from their Sacramental ways and declared independence. During the time of the Northern Crusades, before the many accords and partitions of our state, many referred to the entire Texan Empire as the Empire of Africa. However, no emperor of Texas outright declared himself as the heir to Africa due to the heretical origin. Now that our state has reached a similar height, the same question has emerged in the corners of our capital. If we were to claim the title as heir to that African empire of old, it would need to be under our own circumstances, divorced from the original Sacramental meaning. However, it could also be just symbolically powerful if we deny this change and cling to the heritage of our Texan origins. While we have come to outgrow the humble state we were just centuries ago, must we really adopt a new identity to be recognized for our actions?"

 texan_events.10.d: "With our newly assembled cabinet, the idea has been floated of fully dedicating a portion of imperial funds towards the continued advancements of the arts and sciences. For centuries, our state has been on the cutting edge of discovery, however the intellectuals of our country have always relied upon the generosity of patrons in order to continue their important work. While we have continued to invest heavily in our country’s different academic institutions indirectly, maybe it is time we make some direct contributions."

 texan_events.11.t: "Papal Proposition"
 texan_events.11.d: "We have done well to reclaim the lands of Italy and restore the holy city of Rome, yet there still is the puzzling question of how to manage papal control. It is no surprise that the Pope himself is invested in the political affairs of the Catholic world just as much as the spiritual, so it is unlikely that he will fully give up his political holdings on the continent. However, there is always the possibility the Pope could be convinced to make a trade. Giving up our lands in Italy for his lands in Mexico would allow us to further entrench our position on the continent while ensuring that the true holy sea is in the hands of his eminence. Alternatively, we could hold the land for ourselves and allow the Pope to visit however he likes. Whatever the choice, let it be in the service of heaven above."
