 islamic_nations_will_donate_to_us: "§GSome of our islamic brethren will grant us gifts§!"
 islam_events.3.d: "So far, we have faced an uphill battle in converting our realm’s populace to the straight path. Evidently, despite our commitment, there are still some who have managed to evade our efforts. However, a recent development amongst the faithful citizenry might be the key to ending this situation. A group of extremely zealous Islamists have begun forming city-wide watches which ensure that heretic and heathen groups are prevented from spreading their false faiths. Left alone, they will certainly make our job of conversion much easier. Supporting them officially by offering the different institutions of our state could potentially double their efficacy. On the other hand, we could simply twist the narrative and use their prominence as a way to show off the success of our current endeavor and bolster our administraion."
 islam_events.3.a: "Not our business."
 islam_events.3.b: "Take a leading role."
 islam_events.3.c: "Capitalize on the movement."
 islam_events.4.t: "Debate Over The Straight Path"
 islam_events.4.d: "The “Straight Path”, Sirat al-Mustaqim, is the only true path. This is something which we can all agree on, but beyond that it gets fuzzy. There are many different factions that are a part of the Islamic world, each of which differs in their practice and interpretation of the Quran. While this can certainly serve as a point to divide the faithful, it can also be a useful tool to bolster belief and move forward in a righteous way. A recent debate over a doctrinal matter has split our administration between different camps. From the capital, this issue has spread throughout the realm and now begins to tear apart our internal cohesion. Before it evolves out of our control we can act to prevent disaster."
 islam_events.4.a: "Debate is healthy."
 islam_events.4.b: "Supress their opinions."
 islam_events.4.c: "Crush their movement."
 islam_events.5.t: "A beautiful nation"
 islam_events.5.d: "United both in faith and heart, we have grown into a truly beautiful nation. Just as one can reflect purification through their deeds, a nation can grow to become perfect through their belief and actions. For centuries, the world lived under an age of darkness without his light. It was not until the arrival of Jibreel and his apparition to Darany that man was once again granted the ability to serve him. We must appreciate the circumstances which have led us to this sublime height and assist our brothers of the faith in rising to the same point, no matter their allegience."
 islam_events.5.a: "Mashallah."
 islam_events.6.t: "Homogenous Problems"
 islam_events.6.d: "Total unity brings with it many benefits along with a few drawbacks. In our effort to create a state wholly united under Islam, we neglected to keep a robust diversity of opinion. We now experience signs of a crisis, as most of our citizenry is rooted in their own beliefs without consideration for other opinions. We have two paths forward in order to remedy this issue. Firstly, we could curb our efforts to keep a homogenous society and inspire some disagreement. This would solve our problem, but tarnish the perfect nation we have managed to build. Secondly, we could let the stagnation continue. This action could have dire consequences, causing our realm to fall behind technologically in comparison to our neighbors."
 islam_events.6.a: "We need new ideas!"
 islam_events.6.b: "Ridiculous."
 islam_events.7.t: "The Jizya"
 islam_events.7.d: "As is laid out in the Quran, those that do not follow our holy faith are meant to pay a fee to the state. Our realm’s mission to accept differences has bolstered our realm’s coffers alongside its diversity. Further into the future, as our realm expands into all directions, we will only continue to rake in further profits from the nonbelievers. The money from their ignorance can go towards caring for the poor, educating the populace, or even spreading his word by the sword. Truly, the path of acceptance is the most lucrative one of them all."

 islam_events.8.t: "Infidel Resistance"
 islam_events.8.d: "Not everyone appreciates our efforts to accept those of other faiths. Recently, a large group of pious islamists have petitioned our government to stop their policy of tolerance and commit to converting the various heretics and heathens within our realm. Several traitorous dukes have sided with this crowd and threaten rebellion if we were to reject their demands. It is obvious that we cannot give in to these traitors, but are we really in the correct spot to fight an outright rebellion? Whatever our choice on the matter, it should be calculated to best serve our administration and prevent being pushed around in the future."
 islam_events.8.a: "We accept all."
 islam_events.8.b: "We have been led astray."
 islam_events.9.t: "Brothers In Arms"
 islam_events.9.d: "There is nothing more righteous than fighting alongside our islamic brethren in a war for the future of the faith. In our current conflict, we are joined by [random_ally_for_islam_bin.Monarch.GetName], the [random_ally_for_islam_bin.Monarch.GetTitle] of [random_ally_for_islam_bin.GetName]. Conflicts such as these greatly strengthen the ties between nations like no others. How we use this fact could determine our ultimate success in this war. Inspiring our men with the courage of our ally or deepening our ties with [random_ally_for_islam_bin.GetName] could put us on a more successful path for the future. Let us take this moment to reflect on our bond and move forward along the straight path."
 islam_events.9.a: "Inspire the Men."
 islam_events.9.b: "Deepen our Ties."
 islam_events.10.t: "Clash of the Faith"
 islam_events.10.d: "Our administration's commitment to form a connected community of faithful brothers has been shaken due to our current circumstances. We now battle one of our own islamic brothers in a conflict which threatens to destroy either of our nations. The rest of the islamic world has taken notice, with many of the rulers looking to our’s with shame. Whatever caused us to enter into this conflict, it has now left a deeper scar than imagined for our position on the world stage. If we are to survive what is to come, we must work diligently to improve the community’s opinion of our nation and gain back some goodwill amongst the faithful."
 islam_events.10.a: "Shameful."
 lose_opinion_with_all_clashoffiath: "Lose §R-25§! opinion with all Islamic nations."
 islam_events.11.t: "Islam Abroad"
 islam_events.11.d: "The native peoples of the new world believe in a faith foreign to our own. While the more primitive among them have readily converted to our faith when coaxed, the sophisticated societies of the new world have been more resistant. Some in our administration have proposed that we send out an earnest delegations in order to spread the islamic faith to these unenlightened folk. Among them, [islam_native_to_convert_target.GetName] have shown promise due to their proximity to our colony and their propensity for cooperation. While a delegation may be costly, it might just secure us a new Islamic brother and a key ally across the sea."
 islam_events.11.a: "Why not?"
 islam_events.11.b: "They wouldn't understand."
 rewards_from_converting_a_native: "If our attempt is sucessful we will gain the following:"
 islam_events.12.t: "The Western Faith"
 islam_events.12.d: "The men of the west have arrived on our borders, but this time they do not come with guns or gifts. Instead, they have told us an interesting story. A story of a city, far across the sea, and an angel. A story of a man, Darany, and a mob who killed his father. It is an interesting story, but to these men of the west it is more. They base their lives and societies after this book, most of which have been successful. It is obvious that they expect us to adopt their faith, but is that truly the path which we are meant to take? Let us consider all of the options before making this decision and carefully consider the consequences if we were to throw away our past."
 islam_events.12.a: "There is no other."
 islam_events.12.b: "Never!"
 islam_events.13.t: "New Brothers"
 islam_events.13.d: "Our delegation has proved to be a success! The people of [From.GetName] have converted to the faith of Islam and now spread it to their brethren. There is no doubt that this story will ease the hesitation of many would-be pioneers back home and lead them to make new lives across the waves. While this is all good, we should truly be proud of the fact that we have enlightened these native peoples to his word."
 islam_events.13.a: "Wonderful!"
 islam_events.14.t: "Denied Grace"
 islam_events.14.d: "Our delegation has proved to be a failure. The people of [From.GetName] have resisted our attempts to convert them to the Islamic faith. All of the effort we put into this delegation has now gone to waste, and for that they should be made to pay. Our administration has already begun drawing up the articles of war and laid claim to their lands. We will purge their ignorant chieftains and directly enlighten their populace."
 islam_events.14.a: "Damn!"
 islam_events.15.t: "Guilds Give Back"
 islam_events.15.d: "Our recent commitment to equality has finally begun to pay out dividends. The formation of different mufawadah guilds throughout our nation has streamlined trade and led to greater profits for their partial owners. In an attempt to curry further good will with our state, and even potentially get favorable treatment in the future, a collection of these guilds have granted us a large gift of their earnings. While we could accept this gift and use it for our projects, maybe it would be just as useful to instead ask for some favors from these guilds. This type of partnership could potentially carry over into the future. As they grow in power, these mufawadah guilds will no doubt be influential in our state. Let us make sure that they stay on our side."
 islam_events.15.a: "Accept their donation."
 islam_events.15.b: "Ask for favors instead."
 islam_events.16.t: "Guilds Demand Relief"
 islam_events.16.d: "While the mufawadah organization for our nation’s guilds has provided us many benefits, it occasionally fails. In times such as this, we are expected to pick up the slack and bail out the guilds in order to keep the engine of the economy running. This exact situation now plays out in front of our very own eyes, as our own guilds have begun begging for aid. The amount that they ask for is rather steep, so we would not be looked at as stingy if we were to deny their requests. However, if we were to ignore their demands, our realm’s populace and economy could suffer. We must make our next move carefully to not encourage reckless economic behavior in the future."
 islam_events.16.a: "Bail them out."
 islam_events.16.b: "Their fault, they suffer."
 islam_events.17.t: "Pressing Victory"
 islam_events.17.d: "There are few things that can unite a nation more than war. In our current conflict, we find ourselves battling for the very soul of the Islamic faith. Our brave soldiers stand ready to defeat the heathen foe and come back victorious. Groups from around the nation have contributed to our success against this great evil, and for that we are eternally grateful. In this moment of victory, we should take a moment to reflect and plan our path forward. Should we consolidate and stabilize our nation for the moment, or press our advantage and deliver a decisive blow to the enemy?"
 islam_events.17.a: "Forward, to Victory!"
 islam_events.17.b: "Let us consolidate."
 islam_events.18.t: "Spiritually Battered"
 islam_events.18.d: "Our nation now finds itself at a moment of great weakness as heathen forces threaten to destroy everything we hold dear. Our administration’s focus on war as a religious conflict has backfired in this case as our population grows weary with our loss. Throughout our realm, individuals are losing their faith and beginning to embrace desolate views. While there is little we can do to stop this now, we can look forward to better times in the future in order to stay positive. Let us hope that this will not spell the end for our nation."
 islam_events.18.a: "Even in defeat, we will have grace."
 islam_events.19.t: "Islamization"
 islam_events.19.d: "Within the dirty business of war, nations often find themselves caring for the populace of their foreign enemies. When occupying foreign territory, a nation needs to care for the native people in order to facilitate basic cooperation. While it is usually rare for a local populace to attach themselves to their occupier’s traditions and culture, our commitment to spreading Islam by the sword has inspired one of these groups to convert. A group of local leaders in [islamized_province_aspect_event.GetName] has declared their loyalty to our cause after many in their community converted to the straight path. This once again affirms our conviction that we hold the true faith as even our enemies are only a few steps away from belief."
 islam_events.19.a: "They have been enlightened"
 islam_events.20.t: "Domestic Woes"
 islam_events.20.d: "Our expansion focus has led to its own host of issues. Key among them is a nationwide feeling of neglect due to our actions abroad. While we were subjugating the nonbelievers and carving out a mighty empire, our cities back home have begun to fall into disrepair. A group of different local officials have arrived at our court in order to petition for improvement in their communities. While we could certainly use some of our administration’s resources to repair their communities, this action could potentially distract us from our ultimate goal of expansion."
 islam_events.20.a: "We must turn inward!"
 islam_events.20.b: "We cannot be distracted."
 islam_events.21.t: "Divine Guidance"
 islam_events.21.d: "It is extremely important that a soldier be both firm in their faith and competent in combat. Without either, they will be lost when it comes to battle. Our nation’s new commitment to enforcing this standard has led to great sucess. Throughout the ranks of the military, belief has melded with training and expertise in a way unseen in heathen faiths. After all of the work, we can finally push forward our changes and revolutionize our army for the better. Our only task now is to answer the question of where our superiority lies."
 islam_events.21.a: "We are the most talented."
 islam_events.21.b: "We are the most faithful."
 islam_events.21.c: "I am the best commander."
 islam_events.22.t: "Itchy Army"
 islam_events.22.d: "A well trained military poses little use in times of peace, growing to become a burden during extended breaks from combat. While we certainly appreciate the lack of bloodshed, our army has now become itchy without combat. We are at a difficult crossroads now of whether to continue to train our forces or let them relax during peacetime. With the former, we will no doubt draw ire from the more war averse members of our population. However with the latter, we might lose years of valuable progress in creating a professional army."
 islam_events.22.a: "Let their prowess decay"
 islam_events.22.b: "We cannot be distracted"
 islam_events.23.t: "Prayer Problems"
 islam_events.23.d: "Prayer is one of the most important Islamic rituals, but there is much debate over the exact procedures and frequency of prayer. Most believers pray five times a day, derived from the practices of Originalists from before the appearance of Jibreel. Other more radical groups reject this perspective, seeing the act of prayer as a continuous connection to Allah that does not require a particular ritual. Few fall in between these two groups, which has left us in a difficult position. Many of our subjects see us as a religious authority and our opinion on the matter may be seen as binding for those in the realm. For this reason, we must consider our decision carefully to maintain our public image."
 islam_events.23.a: "Five times, as is tradition."
 islam_events.23.b: "Two times, a nice medium"
 islam_events.23.c: "None, these are useless acts"
 islam_events.24.t: "Royal Garbs"
 islam_events.24.d: "Originalist influence on the Islamic faith cannot be overstated. Even after Jibreel’s appearance, these old-timers continue to press their antiquated beliefs on those that practice the true faith. For this reason, there is a disparity of opinion on many matters which should be clear due to the Quran’s teachings. One of these confusions now presents itself as some in our nation call upon our ruler to dress more modestly. While most muslims can agree that modesty is key, the extent to which one is required to cover up is a hotly debated issue. Many of our subjects see us as a religious authority and our opinion on this matter may be seen as binding for those in the realm. Let us consider the options carefully."
 islam_events.24.a: "We are free to dress as we wish."
 islam_events.24.b: "Modesty is key."
 islam_events.25.t: "Apostasy"
 islam_events.25.d: "A new issue has whipped the different groups of our state into debate after a tragic event. Opinions on apostasy are mostly consistent amongst muslims, with most believing that one should be able to decide on their own faith. However, originalists hold the fringe view that one should be put to death for apostasy. It is this fact that led a father to murder his own son in a fit of rage just a few days ago. Many perceive his actions as unwarranted and now call upon our monarch to have him put to death. On the other hand, many others believe that this was born out of a false belief and should be met with education rather than punishment."
 islam_events.25.a: "Have him put to death!"
 islam_events.25.b: "It was his belief."
 islam_events.26.t: "Art of the Prophet"
 islam_events.26.d: "Art’s expression of emotion and ideas is a powerful tool for any administration and ours is no different. While other states would freely spend their money patronizing artists for their work and using it to bolster their status as centers of culture, we must act more carefully when considering the content. Among the muslim faith, there are some who hold the originalist belief that the prophet should not be depicted in art. While this is a minority opinion, those that believe it would certainly be greatly dissatisfied with our administration if we were to commission art of this kind. In addition, many in our realm look to our ruler as a source of religious authority and may see our decision here as binding. We should carefully consider our next move as it just might set a precedent."
 islam_events.26.a: "A Fruitful Persuit"
 islam_events.26.b: "Idolatry!"
 islam_events.27.t: "The Mystical World"
 islam_events.27.d: "While many originalists practices have managed to worm their way into our correct form of Islam, mysticism has somehow never managed to stick. The rituals of Sufis have never caught on amongst most muslims, with few having even been exposed to the concept. It is for this reason that our administration was shocked to be presented with an offer to worship with one of the last remaining Sufi orders. While we could accept this offer, it would probably cause more trouble than it is worth. Legitimizing such an institution would only work to bolster the claims of the heretical originalists."
 islam_events.27.a: "A fruitful approach."
 islam_events.27.b: "Heresy!"
 islam_events.28.t: "What is Jihad?"
 islam_events.28.d: "The exact nature of Jihad has been a hotly debated issue between the different islamic sects since the beginning of time. Even originalists have a diversity of opinion on the subject. Is a jihad only defensive, is it offensive, or is it just a state of constant struggle against the world? While we certainly do not have any greater insight than anyone else, our opinion on the matter holds a special weight as the leader of our realm. We should carefully consider how we frame our current conflict in terms of jihad in order to better promote our admiistration’s interests."
 islam_events.28.a: "It is a necessary burden."
 islam_events.28.b: "It is an avoidable circumstance."
 islam_events.28.c: "It is a show of faith."
 islam_events.29.t: "Mahkama"
 islam_events.29.d: "The task of administering decisions on different religious matters is tiring. While this is ultimately required of us as a ruler, some in our administration have proposed an alternative that might lighten our burden. Creating a court of scholars which hand out official rulings on different religious disputes might work to take attention away from our own opinions. A Mahkama would accomplish this goal perfectly, in addition to serving an important role as a center of islamic learning. While establishing such an institution would certainly take power away from our own administration, the future prospects of its existence makes our decision on the matter difficult. After musing over the issue, the time has finally come for action. Let us make sure that our choice serves Allah before any other."
 islam_events.29.a: "The experts will sort it out."
 islam_events.29.b: "We hold sole authority."
 islam_events.30.t: "Fiqh For the Followers"
 islam_events.30.d: "The creation of the Mahkama has proved to be a resounding success, but there is still more that could be done to make their administration more efficient. A collection of different Mufti have come to our ruler with a proposition. They request the ability to compile their rulings into a single document and distribute it throughout the realm to the faithful citizenry. This document would solve disputes amongst individual communities without the need for Mahkama intervention in every case. This would further distance us from religious decisions, which would no doubt greatly hurt our administration’s legitimacy. On the other hand, it would greatly improve the Mahkama’s efficiency and allow them to solve novel disputes rather than the same repeated issues."
 islam_events.30.a: "Codification is the war forward."
 islam_events.30.b: "A desperate power grab."
 get_fiqh_islam_upgrade_mahkama: "Mahkama modifier will be replaced with:"
 islam_events.31.t: "Mufti Selection"
 islam_events.31.d: "A court needs judges and jurors. Our own Mahkama has proved to be a useful institution for separating our ruler from the religious decisions of the state, but it requires maintenance in order to ensure that it does not grow to become something that challenges our authority. Curbing the Mahkama’s power is primarily done by selecting its Mufti, which we must do now as a vacancy is now causing a lot of trouble for the judges. Picking someone from our administration or realm who is loyal to our cause will give us greater control over the Mahkama. On the other hand, loyalty is a powerful attribute which may be better used somewhere else in our administration. Perhaps it would be better if the judges themselves chose who should fill the vacancy."
 islam_events.31.a: "One of our missionaries"
 islam_events.31.b: "One of our advisors!"
 islam_events.31.c: "A countryside scholar"
 islam_events.31.e: "Let the experts decide."
 islam_events.32.t: "A Place for Deliberation"
 islam_events.32.d: "Throughout our realm, the Mahkama is now sinking its roots into local governments and communities to solve disputes. However, outside of the capital, there are few places where the different judges can gather to effect change in our nation. In order to remedy this problem, we have the option of spending our income to create centers of deliberation throughout the realm. While these might be costly investments, it is likely that the increased efficiency that they bring will pay for itself in time. Take for example the province of [area_for_potential_local_madresa.GetName], who desperately needs a place for its scholars to gather. Spending our money to found a madrasa there could encourage scholarship in the province for generations."
 islam_events.32.a: "Expand the institution."
 islam_events.32.b: "They are trying to take over!"
 islam_events.33.t: "Begining Our Hajj"
 islam_events.33.d: "Many muslims attempt to complete the Hajj throughout their lifetime, but few have the means to experience it in full. While it is a strictly ceremonial journey, some believe that it brings them closer to God by following in the footsteps of Darany. The pilgrimage’s final destination is the city of Chicago, where the archangel Jibreel appeared to man centuries ago. Typically, rulers who embark on a Hajj lavishly give away their wealth to the downtrodden along the journey in an attempt to assert themselves amongst their islamic brethren. For all of these reasons and more, many in our administration have been pressuring our ruler to take the Hajj. Before we make the decision, we must also consider the downsides before embarking on this journey. Some throughout the islamic world view the Hajj as an heretical belief, drawing its origins from an ancient originalist practice. The road to Chicago is dangerous as well, littered with temptations and thieves."
 islam_events.33.a: "A Wonderous Journey!"
 islam_events.33.b: "Heretical and Dangerous."
 we_will_begin_the_hajj_islam: "§GWe will begin our Hajj to Chicago§!"
 islam_events.34.t: "Ruler dies in Hajj"
 islam_events.34.d: "A horrible fate has befallen our nation as we are left without a clear ruler. Despite the warnings of danger from many throughout our realm, our ruler recklessly embarked on a pilgrimage to Chicago. Their death has now left many throughout our nation to raise their arms and claim the throne. May Allah be with us through this difficult time."
 islam_events.34.a: "The Throne is Mine!"
 islam_events.35.t: "Paying repsects to [ruler_of_chicago.GetName]"
 islam_events.35.d: "The warden of the city of Chicago, [ruler_of_chicago.Monarch.GetName], has graciously allowed us to venture to their realm in order to complete our Hajj. Typically, the pilgrim will pay respect to the warden for their service, yet we do not need to follow what is expected of us. How hard could it really be to maintain order in Chicago?"
 islam_events.35.a: "We thank them for their grace."
 islam_events.35.b: "It is the world's city!"
 islam_events.36.t: "Spreading the wealth"
 islam_events.36.d: "A common practice of pilgrims traveling to Chicago is to spread their wealth by spending lavishly on mosques and donating to the impoverished. Throughout history, many rulers have ravaged the economy of The Great Lakes with their generosity. Consider Ryan Darany, great great grandson of Eugene, who bankrupted the Iowan caliphate and led to its eventual collapse by spending excessively during his Hajj. While we should obviously not follow in his footsteps, the point still stands that spending can have its benefits. It is important to remember, that whatever our actions do to the economy of this region might very well negatively impact us as well."
 islam_events.36.a: "A waste."
 islam_events.36.b: "Perhaps a little bit."
 islam_events.36.c: "Perhaps a bit more."
 islam_events.36.e: "Maybe a little more."
 islam_events.36.f: "Just a tad more."

 islam_events.37.t: "The Wealth of [From.Monarch.GetName]"
 islam_events.37.d: "On their Hajj to Chicago, [From.Monarch.GetName] has flaunted their wealth by spending heavily. This has come to damage our own nation as their excess has disrupted the local economy. Inflation has skyrocketed as their money devalues currency throughout The Great Lakes. Hopefully we can recover from their arrogant display in time."
 islam_events.37.a: "Uh oh."
 islam_events.38.t: "Unholy Thieves"
 islam_events.38.d: "During the night, our party was robbed by thieves! The road to Chicago is full of opportunistic marauders who prey on the wealthy and kind-hearted. Sadly, it seems they have gotten away with their crimes and are nowhere to be found."
 islam_events.38.a: "Horror!"
 islam_events.39.t: "Miracles Along the Way"
 islam_events.39.d: "While on our way to Chicago, we were visited by a local woman who performed miracles for our party. The religiously gifted gather along the route to Chicago in order to show off their talents to the wealthy pilgrims that travel to the city. Some in our party dispute the divine origins of her tricks, but they were nonetheless entertaining."
 islam_events.39.a: "Wonderous!"
 islam_events.40.t: "Disease in the Party"
 islam_events.40.d: "Our party has been struck by a bout of disease! While traveling to Chicago as part of our Hajj, improper hygiene has opened the door for illness to spread amongst our pilgrims. We must carefully navigate the resulting situation to ensure that our ruler stays fit and healthy for the rest of the journey."
 islam_events.40.a: "We will endure."
 islam_events.40.b: "He will protect us."
 islam_events.41.t: "Excessive Celebration"
 islam_events.41.d: "Celebrations are common along the route to Chicago for pilgrims. Our party joined one of these celebrations and took it too far. We are now faced with the difficult task of cleaning up our mess. Of course, we could always shirk our duties and continue on our way to Chicago."
 islam_events.41.a: "We will clean up our mess."
 islam_events.41.b: "We must continue forward."
 islam_events.42.t: "Women of the Streets"
 islam_events.42.d: "Alongside the miracle workers and thieves, there are an abundance of prostitutes on the road to Chicago. Paradoxically, it is a lucrative location for these women of the night despite the holy nature of the Hajj. We now find ourselves among them and some members of our party are beginning to warm up to the idea of taking a quick break during our journey. Perhaps we should indulge this notion, just once."
 islam_events.42.a: "Perhaps just once."
 islam_events.42.b: "Sinful!"
 islam_events.43.t: "Home at Last"
 islam_events.43.d: "After our long pilgrimage, we have finally arrived back home. Some say that travel expands the mind. If this is true, then it follows that holy travel expands the soul. There is no doubt that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been changed by this journey. Walking in the footsteps of the prophet is an experience like no other and truly changes a person. With their new spiritual insight, there is no doubt that our ruler will serve our nation better than ever."
 islam_events.43.a: "A Wonderfoul Journey!"
 islam_events.44.t: "Zakat"
 islam_events.44.d: "Charity is a fundamental part of islam. Giving away one’s wealth is a major pillar of the faith and serves as a positive influence for society. While originalists cling to an exact measure of wealth which must be given away, most muslims generally give what they can afford to. As the ruler of a realm, we are held to a different standard than the common man in our expected charity. Our status grants us a greater level of money and influence, which our populace expects us to reflect in our charitable donations. However, there is no religious document binding us to this expectation, as it is just the opinion of our populace. We are free to give as much, or as little, as we would like."
 islam_events.44.a: "There is no need to give."
 islam_events.44.b: "We must give what is needed."
 islam_events.44.c: "This money belongs to the faithful."
 islam_events.44.e: "Earthly riches are none of our concern."
 islam_events.45.t: "Mahdi Proclamation"
 islam_events.45.d: "The capital is abuzz with the recent proclamation of a local mystic. While most muslims do not believe in a Mahdi figure, the heretical originalists cling to the idea that a savior will emerge during the end of days to guide the faith to the right path. This local mystic has proclaimed himself the Mahdi and subsequently convinced a group of originalists to support this claim. They now march throughout the capital in an attempt to get the common people to recognize their supposed “prophet.” We must make a decision on this group’s legitimacy in order to regain order in the capital."
 islam_events.45.a: "The Massiah!"
 islam_events.45.b: "A lunatic."
 islam_events.46.t: "Wali Worship"
 islam_events.46.d: "Saints have a complicated relationship with Islam. While they are certainly talented individuals with abilities which ought to be recognized, often they are shunned out of an abundance of caution. The worship of these Wali is extremely heretical, even considered to be shameful among the originalists. With this in mind, we are now put in a difficult position as one of our own advisors has been discovered to be a Wali worshiper. We have few options available to us in these circumstances. Of course, we can strip them of their titles and remove them from our administration, but that would likely be a costly endeavor. Perhaps it is best that we let them continue their practice in private to avoid the process of replacing them."
 islam_events.46.a: "Remove them from government."
 islam_events.46.b: "No one needs to know."
 islam_events.47.t: "The Originalists"
 islam_events.47.d: "Originalists are a peculiar group. Even before Jibreel appeared to the people of Chicago, there were a few groups who considered themselves muslims and carried traditions of Islam from before the flood. Most of these groups flocked to Chicago and embraced the new Islam when Jibreel gave the Quran back to man, however some resisted this change and clung to their beliefs. These originalists have been a consistent thorn in the side of the Islamic world, as they challenge a lot of the conventional beliefs with their heretical ones. Most realms have chosen to exclude them from their administration and exile them, but we have yet to make an official decision on the matter."
 islam_events.47.a: "Embrace them."
 islam_events.47.b: "They have no place in our state."
 islam_events.48.t: "Purist Backlash"
 islam_events.48.d: "Our embrace of the originalists has brought with it backlash from the rest of our realm’s citizenry. The reviled status of the originalists has led many in our realm to raise up arms against them and declare an open jihad. Of course, we cannot let these citizens rise up and attack other members of our state. We are now forced to intervene on the behalf of the heretics in order to ensure their safety within our realm. Despite our differences, violence against the originalists will only lead to a more bloody society."
 islam_events.48.a: "Damn!"
 islam_events.49.t: "Mecca: The Ancient City"
 islam_events.49.d: "Mecca was an ancient city before the flood which housed the Kaaba and served as the center of Islam. After the fall of man, the city was presumed to be lost by many originalist and islamic scholars, but we have found what we believe is the genuine site of the city in Fayettia. Word has already begun to spread of the discovery, as many in the islamic world begin to ponder about what this means for the rest of the Quran’s content. We must act quickly to kick out the native tribes and settle the city in order to begin its restoration. Perhaps, one day, Mecca may be restored to its former glory."
 islam_events.49.a: "Wonderous"
 islam_events.50.t: "Originalists Flock to Mecca"
 islam_events.50.d: "The discovery of Mecca has impacted originalist communities the most as they come to grapple with the fact that the city still exists. Initially, many were skeptical of the discovery, believing that it was a “progressive lie.” When its validity was shown through the artifacts brought back to our nation, the originalists began to flock in droves to the city in order to see it in person. Occasionally, we will see spikes in emmigration as the originalists flock to the city. By their hand, Mecca is slowly moving towards total restoration."
 islam_events.50.a: "Interesting"
 islam_events.51.t: "Jibreel Aparition"
 islam_events.51.d: "In the farthest corners of our nation, news has emerged of a sighting of Jibreel. Throughout history, the archangel has appeared to multiple prophets in order to deliver important information. Multiple accounts testified to his appearance, but there was little agreement on what was actually said. Whatever the case, this news has emboldened our populace’s faith and supported our administration’s commitment to spreading islam throughout the world. Let us take this as a sign of a successful future for our nation."
 islam_events.51.a: "Interesting"
 islam_events.52.t: "To Honor Darany"
 islam_events.52.d: "The original prophet of the Islamic faith, Darany, rose to prominence for his leading role in Chicago during the years following Jibreel’s appearance. His death by the hands of dynastic extremists directly led to the formation of the Iowan caliphate and spread of Islam. For this reason he is revered by muslims throughout the world, but his martyrdom is celebrated differently amongst the groups of islamic society. Most celebrate his sacrifice and remember his influence on the anniversary of his death called “The Martyr’s Day.” However, Islamic scholars use the holiday as an occasion for compilation, fasting and reflecting on the natural world. Others reject the holiday outright, believing that it is heretical practice which worships the prophet rather than Allah."
 islam_events.52.a: "We will celebrate."
 islam_events.52.b: "We will contemplate."
 islam_events.52.c: "Who cares?"
 islam_events.53.t: "Industrial Islam"
 islam_events.53.d: "The wonderful abilities of coal have led to a great revolution of innovation, yet there are still some areas in which our production could be improved. The Islamic work ethic has benefited our nation for centuries, but seems to be unfit for this growing age of capitalistic competition. If we were to tweak our beliefs to fit into the modern age, perhaps we could get a competitive edge over our economic rivals. On the other hand, perhaps it would be better if the progress we now enjoy served to strengthen our ties to tradition rather than diminish its presence. Whatever our choice, it will be better than the middle ground we now find ourselves stuck in."
 islam_events.53.a: "Let it serve the faith."
 islam_events.53.b: "Let the faith serve it."
 islam_events.54.t: "Science and Islam"
 islam_events.54.d: "Ever since the days of the Iowan caliphate, Islam has served to advance the investigation of the natural world in a harmonious blend of theology and science. Our progress throughout the ages has only continued to bolster our belief in the straight path. Our newest commitment to the natural world has come to upset this gentle balance in a way that may be advantageous to us. Let us choose a focus which works to bolster whatever we find most convenient."
 islam_events.54.a: "It is the study of his natural world."
 islam_events.54.b: "It would better to focus on his word."
 islam_events.55.t: "The Buckeye Caliph"
 islam_events.55.d: "[From.Monarch.GetName] has recently declared themselves the successor to Darany’s caliphate, proclaiming the new Ohio Caliphate. Centuries after the fall of the Iowans, the islamic world once again has a nation which seeks to unite all of the faithful under one banner. While we are not obliged to join them, we can assist them in their endeavors. Sending a small gift to the new caliph could improve our relations with this powerful nation and grant some legitimacy to their claims. In the same vein, we could also refuse to acknowledge their declaration and damage their standing on the world stage. Whatever our choice, let us make sure that it puts the interests of the faith before our own."
 islam_events.55.a: "We will send a gift!"
 islam_events.55.b: "Interesting."
 islam_events.56.t: "Yoroppa Ambitions"
 islam_events.56.d: "The new world in the west is proving to be a large draw for the colonially inclined amongst our populace. Islam serves as a powerful tool to encourage this colonization, as many in our nation believe that they have a religious duty to educate the natives of Akilineq to the straight path. Recently, news of miracles occurring amongst the native populations of the new world has created a feveror for colonization amongst our populace. Throughout our realm, people now flock to the coasts in order to catch a ship to our new world colonies. Let us hope that they stay committed to their faith, no matter the temptations they face!"
 islam_events.56.a: "Across the waves!"
 islam_events.57.t: "Khamr"
 islam_events.57.d: "Consumption of alcohol is a taboo amongst muslims, mostly due to the harsh stigma against it held by originalists. However, there is no such stigma against its production. As our state produces wine, many have begun to question where exactly the good should end up. Some have proposed that we sell it abroad, making money off of the sinful practices of the heretics and heathens that surround us. While this would certainly be the lucrative path, others have claimed that doing this would be akin to supporting our enemies. Instead, they claim that we should exclusively sell the goods within our own borders for any who want it."
 islam_events.57.a: "We could never!"
 islam_events.57.b: "A originalist lie."
 islam_events.58.t: "Bayt al-mal"
 islam_events.58.d: "Throughout the history of islamic states, the process of managing financial transactions has been extremely difficult due to the complexity and volume of exchanges. During the days of Iowa, their caliphs created a single central body to handle the distribution of taxes and welfare of the state: Bayt al-mal. While the Bayt al-mal eventually fell with the caliphate, its legacy still lives on in the rest of the islamic world. If we were to establish such an institution, it is likely that we could better manage our finances and invest back into our state. Make no mistake, it would be a costly venture. However, in the end it may prove to be far more lucrative than the establishing costs."
 islam_events.58.a: "A Useful Institution"
 islam_events.58.b: "Expensive and Unecessary"
 lead_to_more_positive_events: "§GThis could lead to more positive events in the future§!"
 islam_events.59.t: "Welfare of the Faithful"
 islam_events.59.d: "The impacts of our centralized financial institution, Bayt al-mal, have already begun to emerge in our populace’s welfare. The redistribution of efficiently farmed taxes has improved the general standard of living throughout our realm in a manner previously unseen. Truly, a wise investment."
 islam_events.59.a: "Wonderful"
 islam_events.60.t: "Edcated Populace"
 islam_events.60.d: "The impacts of our centralized financial institution, Bayt al-mal, continue to only exceed our expectations. The control over our state’s finances provided by the institution has allowed for more investments into the education of our populace. The better lives that our people now lead have created a society of scholars. Our new advancement is truly exciting."
 islam_events.60.a: "Wonderful"
 islam_events.61.t: "Originalists Flock to Colonies"
 islam_events.61.d: "Due to persecution they have faced from the different purist factions in our realm, several originalists have begun flocking to our colonies. While their circumstances at home are certainly regrettable, their movement to our colonies will bolster our new world presence. Let us just hope that they do not spread their heretical beliefs to these new world natives."
 islam_events.61.a: "Perfect."
