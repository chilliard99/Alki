 collectivist_events.1.t: "Disorganized Masses"
 collectivist_events.1.d: "Communes are the basic unit of Collectivist organization, in which a community of the pious are gathered together to share their resources and move towards utopia. The desired scope of a commune often depends on an individual's interpretation of The Manifesto ranging from towns to entire nations. Our realm has found it convenient to construct communes on the basis of state, with each province requesting what it needs from the statewide store. Inevitably, some provinces will be required to contribute more to the state’s store than others, leading to disparities in labor across the state. This disparity has recently led to one of our provinces being behind on their quotas and contributing less to the state store than was required. In times like these, the ruler of a Collectivist realm is meant to step in and cover the difference, but can we afford that during this time? Using any more of our political capital may put us in a deficit, maybe it would be better if we let them slack behind or do nothing at all."
 collectivist_events.1.a: "We must intervene!"
 collectivist_events.1.b: "Give them a break."
 collectivist_events.1.c: "Too much effort."
 collectivist_events.2.t: "Labrorers Flock to Communes"
 collectivist_events.2.d: "Pious laborers throughout our realm have flocked to our communes in order to work towards Utopia. Utopia is a vague concept, so vague that no two Collectivists can nail down an exact definition. Is it a heaven-like realm that you go to after you die? Is it a state of enlightenment? Is it a completely secular state of harmony from a society united in toil? Depending on which Collectivist you ask, you might get a different answer. Despite this incongruity, the pursuit of Utopia is universally agreed to be achieved through common work. It is this belief that has driven the laborers of our realm to travel to our commune and bolster its population."
 collectivist_events.2.a: "Perfect"
 collectivist_events.3.t: "Exemplifying Collectivist Ideals"
 collectivist_events.3.d: "One of our own communes has reached such a high status that it now serves as a model for others throughout the Collectivist world. Through perfecting its efficiency and adopting routine, this commune is one of the most productive in the Collectivist world. Those that toil away on their projects have come to embody the ideals of a Collectivist society. Under these enlightened laborers, we have been moved one step forward to Utopia. Let us take a moment to celebrate their accomplishments and relish in their solidarity before getting back to work."
 collectivist_events.3.a: "Perfect"
 collectivist_events.4.t: "Collectivism Breeds Innovation"
 collectivist_events.4.d: "The struggle between modernization and the commune is a tale as old as time. The craft of creating a routine is essential for most communes, for without it production is unorganized and inefficient. When factors of new technology are introduced into these routines, it often requires the entire process to be retooled with the innovations in mind. This has led many communes to shun the acceptance of new technology in lieu of their traditional practices. This same pattern has come to repeat itself in one of our own communes. If we were to force them to adopt the new innovations, it would likely hurt their organization in the short term but be beneficial overall."
 collectivist_events.4.a: "They will appreciate the advancement."
 collectivist_events.4.b: "They will come to it in time."
 collectivist_events.5.t: "Collective Action"
 collectivist_events.5.d: "A great horror has befallen our realm as one of our own communes has come to rebel against our rule. In a swift move, the laborers of our provinces laid down their tools and refused to work. They now demand that we accept their long list of unfavorable demands. They desire a smaller quota, a greater portion of the commune store, and our personal blessing. While this would typically be a matter resolved by the different members of the statewide commune, their strike has become too large for the state to manage. We are now left in the unenviable position of dealing with this crisis. If we accept their demands, we would likely destabilize our rule and be viewed as weak in the eyes of some of our subjects. On the other hand, letting them continue their revolt could be disastrous for our realm’s production. Even further, some more communes may begin to launch revolutions of their own. Our next actions must be carefully planned in order to prevent a total disaster. "
 collectivist_events.5.a: "We will not be bullied into accepting!"
 collectivist_events.5.b: "They will come to it in time."
 collectivist_revolution_warning.tt: "This province will continue to strike, with the potential to §Rspread to neighboring provinces§!, until the event §YStrike Disintegrates§! happens "
 collectivist_events.6.t: "Commune Revolt Impacts Supply"
 collectivist_events.6.d: "The current strike has begun to impact our realm’s supply chain. The strikers have started to use more destructive tactics to get across their message, by preventing travel of merchants and goods through their province. While we can supplement these losses from our own store, we would only be delaying the untidy process of solving this problem for another ruler. Alternatively, we could simply employ our realm’s military to suppress the strike and return the commune to normalcy. This would certainly provoke open conflict between us and the strikers, but such measures are necessary when the realm is at risk. Some of our advisors have even proposed that we do nothing to aid in the supply chain shortage, letting the other communes feel the pain of the shortage and turn against their striking brethren. "
 collectivist_events.6.a: "Intervene Directly."
 collectivist_events.6.b: "Mitigate the Losses."
 collectivist_events.7.t: "Commune Launches Nationwide Revolt"
 collectivist_events.7.d: "The worst has come to pass, as the striking communes have openly revolted against our realm. Instead of passively sitting by and disrupting our economy, the strikers have raised arms against our realm for direct action. This open revolt will no doubt cause waves of instability across our country and many deaths. We must now call upon every citizen willing to defend the dream of Utopia to crush these troublemakers and restore order. "
 collectivist_events.7.a: "Damn!"
 collectivist_events.8.t: "Commune Strike Spreads to Other Provinces"
 collectivist_events.8.d: "Our striking Commune has spread its dangerous ideas to one of its neighboring provinces. As their numbers grow, our nation continues to be put at a state of further unrest and instability. The potential ramifications of a nationwide revolt only grows. We must be vigilant for any signs of violence amongst these misguided laborers."
 collectivist_events.8.a: "Horror!"
 collectivist_events.9.t: "Strike Disintegrates"
 collectivist_events.9.d: "After a lot of turmoil, our striking commune has finally decided to get back to work. Their dwindling supplies and lack of progress snuffed out the revolutionary flames. With our nation once again at peace, we must get back to the task of rebuilding their routines and achieving Utopia. For just a moment, let us celebrate our newfound harmony, for there's no telling how long it will last."
 collectivist_events.9.a: "Peace is Regained!"
 collectivist_events.10.t: "Communes Perfect Wartime Production"
 collectivist_events.10.d: "War is a messy business, especially for the communes of our state. They are required to shift their routines and production to fit the necessary resources of war, a process which destroys production and efficiency. Despite this, one of our communes has struck gold with their shift. They somehow managed to quickly shift their production and perfect their wartime production. Implementing their practices in other communes throughout our nation, we could produce armaments at a cheaper cost and turn the tide of the war in our favor. Together we will crush the consumerist swine!"
 collectivist_events.10.a: "Excellent"
 collectivist_events.11.t: "Legacy of the Father"
 collectivist_events.11.d: "Marx is known as the father of Collectivism for his pivotal role in recording the Manifesto and creating the first commune. It is by his hand that the men of Rusland were enlightened to the truth of Utopia and traveled east into Alaska. We are thankful for his advancements and now embrace him as the model of our realm’s solidarity. However, there are some in our realm who are confused about what Marx represents for our interests. Should he stand for our progress, so that we may bring humanity forward to a new technological age? Or should he stand for our solidarity, so that every citizen of our realm may become one with their labor? "
 collectivist_events.11.a: "We Embrace his Freedom of Thought!"
 collectivist_events.11.b: "We Embrace his Unity!"
 collectivist_events.12.t: "Sacramental Confusion"
 collectivist_events.12.d: "Sacramentals, Constitutionalists, and many others find our way of life confusing. Few can fully grasp the idea of Utopia, especially since most Collectivists have a different idea of what it is exactly, so it is no wonder that others are resistant to our religion. This problem has plagued Collectivist realms ever since the men of Rusland crossed into Alaska centuries ago, but has become especially prevalent in our state with our new Sacramental citizens. Some of our advisors have suggested we employ a novel tactic, gently introducing these Sacramentalists to the concepts of Collectivism through relating it to their own belief. Since we have embraced Marx as a model for our realm, our advisors suggest that we relate him to Elohim in our conversion efforts. While this is certainly a heretical move, it might go far in ensuring that our nation becomes united under the Spectre’s watch."
 collectivist_events.12.a: "No, Marx is not Elohim."
 collectivist_events.12.b: "Sure... Whatever you say."
 collectivist_events.13.t: "Grace of Lenin"
 collectivist_events.13.d: "Lenin is known as “The Graceful” amongst Collectivists for his actions in Rusland centuries ago. During his life, Lenin ushered in Collectivism into his nation and gently introduced the populace to its tenets. His actions were recorded and translated into the book of Lenin in The Manifesto as a guide for future rulers to maintain their Collectivist realms. Our nation now seeks to model our production after his grace to prevent the turmoil of instability and hardships of revolution. Let us now act in accordance to the Spectre to reach Utopia beyond."
 collectivist_events.13.a: "We model ourselves after him."
 collectivist_events.14.t: "Complacent Populace"
 collectivist_events.14.d: "Our embrace of Lenin’s grace has led our nation to an era of unprecedented peace and stability. By avoiding the traps of divisive thought and revolution, our people are complacent and happy with their work. Our subjects have come to recognize this state and are starting to wonder how it came about. Making a public statement on the current status of our realm could help bolster our own power, increase the solidarity of our citizenry, or even inspire them to work more efficiently. Let us celebrate the gifts that Lenin’s guidance has granted us, for more years of stability lie ahead."
 collectivist_events.14.a: "Together, to Utopia!"
 collectivist_events.14.b: "It was by their hands!"
 collectivist_events.14.c: "It was by our hand!"
 collectivist_events.15.t: "A Global Revolution"
 collectivist_events.15.d: "The Book of Trotsky within the Manifesto holds a much different tone than the rest of the text. It argues for a global Collectivist state, making the claim that it is necessary for Collectivists to expand and convert the consumerist swine. Due to this fact, Trotsky is seen as the icon of war for most Collectivist realms. We now find ourselves in a conflict against the very swines which we are meant to convert. We must come out victorious in this war, for the sake of our people and the Collectivist world."
 collectivist_events.15.a: "Crush the pigs!"
 collectivist_events.16.t: "One Large Union Grand"
 collectivist_events.16.d: "In The Manifesto, Trotsky argues for the creation of a global Collectivist state which will usher in an age of enlightenment. Many within our nation have taken this to mean that the larger our realm, the closer we will get to achieving Utopia. As one of the largest nations in the world, we have done well to work towards this goal. While there is still much more land to conquer, more swines to convert, and more scabs to punish, let us take this moment to relish in all we have accomplished. Together, in hand with the Spectre and the founders, we will usher humanity into a new age of enlightenment."
 collectivist_events.16.a: "Together, to Utopia!"
 collectivist_events.17.t: "Maoist Inspiration"
 collectivist_events.17.d: "The Book of Mao details the rise of Mao in southern Rusland and his conversion of the native peoples of the region to Collectivism. Southern Rusland was far more populated and less developed than northern Rusland, which required Mao to implement extensive programs to inspire Collectivism. Mao commonly moved laborers into different industries throughout the realm in order to further bolster weaker areas of the nation’s economy. We now find ourselves in a similar situation, as we could use more soldiers in our army. If we were to draft some of the proletariat to serve, who would that hurt?"
 collectivist_events.17.a: "It would certainly benefit us."
 collectivist_events.17.b: "Ridiculous!"
 collectivist_events.18.t: "Wartime Solidarity"
 collectivist_events.18.d: "Our nation’s embrace of Mao as a Collectivist Icon has inspired members of the proletariat to join the military. In dark times such as these, we welcome any who wish to come forward and move us towards victory. Their bravery will bolster the morale of the proletariat throughout our country and move us one step closer to Utopia."
 collectivist_events.18.a: "Wonderful!"
 collectivist_events.19.t: "Urban Solidarity"
 collectivist_events.19.d: "The Book of Stalin recounts the idol’s quest to reach paradise in Rusland. Being handed the rule of the realm from Trotsky, Stalin decided to settle down and attempt to labor towards Utopia by improving every aspect of the state. For this reason, Stalin has served as the icon of development and production for Collectivist realms ever since. Our nation has now embraced his guidance but must grapple with the troubling matter of developing urban centers. In order to create Collectivist living spaces, the existing city structures must be torn down and rebuilt. This will no doubt damage the conditions of the area, but keeping it the same would damage our solidarity."
 collectivist_events.19.a: "Reform the City."
 collectivist_events.19.b: "Leave it Alone."
 collectivist_events.20.t: "Populating the Countryside"
 collectivist_events.20.d: "Through our embrace of Stalin’s Icon, we have set our realm on a path of inward development. During this time, we must ensure that our citizens have the same resources available to them no matter their location. This requires us to work on developing the countryside in addition to our urban centers. Typically, our citizens will flock to the hinterlands by themselves and establish communities, but there is no guarantee that they will explicitly follow our style of communal planning. Of course, if we require settlers to model their communities after our standards, less will be willing to join the frontier."
 collectivist_events.20.a: "Plan a Communal Community."
 collectivist_events.20.b: "Let settlers decide."
 collectivist_events.21.t: "Balance of Powers"
 collectivist_events.21.d: "The question of power in Collectivist society, like most other aspects, is heavily contested between different individuals. Some believe that there should be no centralized power in a true Collectivist society, while others believe that some centralization is necessary to organize productions. The question of power often ties into other aspects of Collectivist philosophy, such as the exact nature of Utopia and interpretations of the Manifesto. For this reason, rulers often shy away from commenting on such issues to prevent damaging their public image. We have recently been put in the unenviable position of stating our opinion as one of our realm’s philosophers has publicly demanded that we do. If we were to say that the proletariat are the ones who should wield power, we would likely foster solidarity among them. On the other hand, it would deal a blow to the legitimacy of our rule."
 collectivist_events.21.a: "The people lead!"
 collectivist_events.21.b: "We lead!"
 collectivist_events.22.t: "Ascetic Demands"
 collectivist_events.22.d: "There is one thing which all Collectivists hate: greed. The Manifesto preaches the evil of the Consumerist swine and their endless quest for more and more wealth. These factors have led many Collectivists to pursue an ascetic lifestyle, free from worldly posessions. As the ruler of a powerful realm, we have garnered a decent living for ourselves which has come to be a problem. Many of our citizens demand we give up our wealth and devote it to different causes throughout the realm. Succumbing to their demands would certainly inspire further national Solidarity, but might leave us in a pit of debt."
 collectivist_events.22.a: "It is unbecoming."
 collectivist_events.22.b: "They are no one."
 collectivist_events.23.t: "Spectrical Movement"
 collectivist_events.23.d: "The Spectre is a complicated part of Collectivism which is referred to only in passing. Few philosophers have declared its existence and even fewer have pondered its implications. The Spectre is mentioned briefly in The Manifesto, as a being which looms over the Consumerist nations of the world inspiring their people to convert to Collectivism. While many believe that this being has little influence in achieving Utopia, a new movement claims the exact opposite. The Spectricalists believe that they must worship the Spectre to usher in Utopia and have begun to spread this idea to our citizens. This belief is strictly heretical, but branding it as such will likely incite the Spectricalists to rebel against our state."
 collectivist_events.23.a: "Publically Denounce the Movement."
 collectivist_events.23.b: "Embrace its Ideas."
 collectivist_events.23.c: "Supress the Movement."
 collectivist_events.24.t: "Sharing the Wealth"
 collectivist_events.24.d: "Our realm’s gold mine has reliably served as a source for national funds ever since its foundation, but some of our citizens have recently taken objection to its use. They claim that the gold should be distributed amongst the populace, or at least some portion of it should be spread around. While this can be accomplished, it would likely require us to deplete a large section of the mine."
 collectivist_events.24.a: "It is the public's gold."
 collectivist_events.24.b: "Its obviously our gold."
 collectivist_events.25.t: "Union Sentiment"
 collectivist_events.25.d: "For a long time we have been allied with one of our Collectivist brothers. Through thick and thin, we have stayed by their side and aided them in crisis. Some of our citizens have recently expressed a desire to unite with our ally into one grand union. Extending the offer of union would likely impact the Solidarity of our populace, but would have the powerful upside of expanding our state without war. Whatever the response, we will miss out on a powerful opportunity by not sending out this offer."
 collectivist_events.25.a: "It is worth a shot."
 collectivist_events.25.b: "We are better as allies."
 promise_of_union.tt: "If our ally accepts this offer we will annex them."
 collectivist_events.26.t: "The Promise of Union"
 collectivist_events.26.d: "One of our Collectivist brethren has recently reached out to us and offered to take us in as part of their own realm. This would end our nation’s existence, but would move the Collectivist world towards total unity. Whatever our choice, let it be for the advancement towards Utopia."
 collectivist_events.26.a: "Prosperity for All!"
 collectivist_events.26.b: "No Thanks."
 collectivist_events.27.t: "Union Acceptance"
 collectivist_events.27.d: "Our ally has accepted our offer of union and joined our nation. Celebrations have broken out in the streets of the capital as our citizens embrace their new brothers and sisters. This act has taken the Collectivist world one more step towards total unity. May this be the first of many!"
 collectivist_events.27.a: "Wonderous!"
 collectivist_events.28.t: "Union Denial"
 collectivist_events.28.d: "Our ally has refused our offer of union. While this is not the end of the world, it will likely sour relations between our two nations. We hope that they will continue to see us as a strong ally into the future."
 collectivist_events.28.a: "We were overambitious."
 collectivist_events.29.t: "Collectivist Frontier"
 collectivist_events.29.d: "Land is finite, but the desire of Collectivists to spread their belief is unlimited. Sometimes this causes issues for different realms which can evolve into conflict. We now experience this very issue as many of our own citizens flock to the borders of our state to establish communities. As they slowly bleed over into our neighbors territory, they may face persecution or even outright hostility from the heathens. Recalling them back to our borders would likely solve this crisis, but unnerve some of our citizens as we control their freedom of movement. On the other hand, letting them settle in foreign borders would help to spread Collectivism while angering our neighbors."
 collectivist_events.29.a: "Recall them back to our borders."
 collectivist_events.29.b: "Let them go wherever they please."
 collectivist_events.30.t: "Collectivists Cross Into Our Borders"
 collectivist_events.30.d: "Some foreign Collectivists have crossed into our border and begun to spread their beliefs. This is obviously a challenge to our own national authority and must be dealt with swiftly. Regardless whether we route them out or allow them to settle, the realm where they came from must be made to pay for disregarding the borders of our realm."
 collectivist_events.30.a: "Well, they are here now."
 collectivist_events.30.b: "Crush them!"
 collectivist_events.31.t: "Doctrinal Debate"
 collectivist_events.31.d: "Collectivists are extremely dogmatic in their beliefs. This would not be a large problem if it wasn’t for the fact that most Collectivists disagree on essential doctrine. For instance, on the subject of the Manifesto, some believe it to be a document that holds divine significance as a link to Utopia while others believe it to just be a document of guidance created by a group of pious individuals. Even further, some believe that the Manifesto was created by a supernatural being called the Spectre who will usher in an age of global Collectivism once the proletariat reaches a level of harmony. All of this is to say that Collectivists are heavily divided on aspects of the doctrine. For this reason, rulers often avoid giving their particular opinions in order to offend the least amount of believers. When they do eventually have to give an opinion, it always results in a large portion of the populace being horrified at what they think. We are now placed into this difficult position as scholars throughout our nation ask our opinion on some obscure doctrine."
 collectivist_events.31.a: "We Are Correct."
 collectivist_events.31.b: "Giving in is much Easier."
 collectivist_events.32.t: "Pedantic Advisor"
 collectivist_events.32.d: "Philosophers are the most headache-inducing of advisors. Our royal advisor has repeatedly published theses on a number of different issues in the Collectivist world and even included our ruler’s private positions on the matter. Since Collectivists are so thoroughly divided on matters of doctrine, our ruler is now viewed in a negative light by many of our citizens. This philosopher must be made to pay for his transgressions, the only question is whether we should look towards replacing him or go for a different type of advisor."
 collectivist_events.32.a: "Get him out of there."
 collectivist_events.32.b: "Find someone better."
 collectivist_events.33.t: "Exporting Collectivism"
 collectivist_events.33.d: "Traveling across the seas to this brave new world has given us the opportunity to spread Collectivism to a completely new group of native peoples. Spending our effort educating them and converting them to the true faith will likely make them more likely to civilize. On the other hand, maybe our effort is better spent towards encouraging more colonists to travel to the frontier. Whatever our choice, let it be in the service of achieving Utopia, no matter the continent."
 collectivist_events.33.a: "Educate the natives."
 collectivist_events.33.b: "Make more room for our men."
 collectivist_events.34.t: "Trade Criticisms"
 collectivist_events.34.d: "There are certain things which rulers are forced to do for the good of their citizenry. A large portion of our state’s income comes from trading with the consumerist swine. Even though their money actively works towards dismantling the institutions of global greed, some of our citizens have begun to take objection to our corporations. They now demand that we curb our foreign trade. While we are under no obligation to accept their requests, it is likely that continuing to trade will cause many throughout the nation to become frustrated with our rule. On the other hand, cutting back our trade with the pigs will likely lead to economic hardship."
 collectivist_events.34.a: "They are the good capitalist swine."
 collectivist_events.34.b: "They are correct."
 collectivist_events.35.t: "Collectivist Artwork"
 collectivist_events.35.d: "Collectivist artists have routinely enjoyed a high status within their communities. While Sacramentalists or Constitutionalists may think that art serves no purpose for their society, Collectivists see the value that its expression can bring. Our own realm has recently produced a very talented artist whose work has become appreciated throughout the Collectivist world. They could prove to be a valuable asset in furthering the Collectivist cause if they were encouraged to pursue art which inspires solidarity. While this would likely restrict some of their own personal expression, the world would benefit."
 collectivist_events.35.a: "Let the artists decide"
 collectivist_events.35.b: "Artwork should inspire unity"
 collectivist_events.36.t: "The International"
 collectivist_events.36.d: "Throughout the history of Collectivism, few have managed to unite all believers into a single state. Many theologians have argued for the creation of one large union for centuries, but the political will to create such an institution has never materialized. In this new modern age of innovations, revolutions, and nationalism the idea has gained a more mainstream relevance among educated Collectivists. As the leader of the Collectivist world, we would no doubt be the prime candidate to create such an institution. The International would only function properly if the rest of the Collectivist world joined our cause. With the faithful behind us, we more reasonably move towards a global Collectivist revolution. We must seriously consider the ramifications of such an institution as we endeavor to reach Utopia, in this life and beyond."
 collectivist_events.36.a: "We will lead such an institution"
 collectivist_events.36.b: "A waste of time"
 international_description_collectivist.tt: "Every §YCollectivist§! nation will be given the opertunity to join the International and become part of our nation."
 collectivist_events.37.t: "Joining the International?"
 collectivist_events.37.d: "One of our Collectivist brethren has recently declared the foundation of a Pancollectivist International. They have reached out to us to join their new union. Accepting this offer would mean the dissolution of our state and loss of national sovereignty, but we would become part of something greater. A united Collectivist International could rival the most powerful nations on the American continent and even work towards the dream of a global Collectivist union. We must consider this opportunity carefully."
 collectivist_events.37.a: "Of Course!"
 collectivist_events.37.b: "A waste of time."
 collectivist_events.38.t: "International Acendent"
 collectivist_events.38.d: "The International experiment has been a profound success. We have done what all others before us have failed to do in uniting the Collectivist world. The path that lies before us now is full of opportunities. We must go forward and spread the word of Utopia to all those that will listen. All of the workers of this world will be freed from their oppression and given their own path to paradise. Together we will succeed, Solidarity Forever!"
 collectivist_events.38.a: "Of Course!"
 collectivist_events.39.t: "International Collapse"
 collectivist_events.39.d: "The International experiment has failed in a spectacular fashion. All across our nation, different Collectivists are now rising up against our rule. Due to the unstable state of our nation, there is little we can do to stop them. Despite what others may say, we have done something great in uniting the Collectivist world for our short time. Our actions here have paved the way for future generations to achieve what we could not. May they forgive us for our inability. Let us never forget that together we will succeed, Solidarity Forever!"
 collectivist_events.39.a: "Horror!"
 collectivist_events.40.t: "Spectre Sighting"
 collectivist_events.40.d: "A remote village in our realm has recently reported a sighting of the elusive Spectre. The Spectre is a mythical being spoken about in the Manifesto which watches over the Consumerists and encourages their proletariat to convert to Collectivism. Some schools of Collectivist thought believe that the Spectre is a representative of Utopia and is therefore a divine figure. Occasionally, the Spectre will appear before Collectivists who are at their lowest and inspire them to continue working. We are eternally thankful for the Spectre’s visit to our realm and hope that his gaze will lead up down a righteous path."
