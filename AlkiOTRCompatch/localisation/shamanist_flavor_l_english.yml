 shamanist_reform_1: "Spirit Warriors"
 shamanist_reform_1_desc: "Our tribe is not one that longs for war, but if we are to come into conflict we must be prepared. Our elders tell us of a time long ago, when our ancestors fought against other tribes of the land. They donned the masks of evil spirits to frighten the opposing armies. If we are to prepare for combat, let us take on the guise of the wicked and cast out those who threaten our families."
 shamanist_reform_2: "National Rituals"
 shamanist_reform_2_desc: "The shaman is the center of our tribe. Through his help, the sick are healed and the children are raised. The shaman is powerful through his rituals. Through performing certain rites, the spirits of the world can be manipulated. The great power of the shaman has rarely been used for the betterment of the entire tribe, let us give him the resources he needs to ensure that all are covered under his magic."
 shamanist_reform_3: "Raise Ologun"
 shamanist_reform_3_desc: "The heartland is full of many threats. Hostile tribes, great beasts, and disease lurk in the dark corners of the jungle. They wait to take advantage of our pious populace during times of peace. To protect the nation from these malevolent forces, we must create a regiment of peacetime warriors. The Ologun will protect our family from every force of nature that threatens to tear it apart."
 shamanist_reform_4: "Begin Heartland Settlement"
 shamanist_reform_4_desc: "Just outside the reach of our tribe lies the Heartland. Centuries ago, our ancestors thrived among the creatures of this land. They worked hand in hand with the earth to ensure prosperity across all tribes. Our elders tell us this, passed down to them from the elders of before. We must reclaim these lost lands and once again thrive."
 shamanist_reform_5: "Unite the Houses"
 shamanist_reform_5_desc: "Our faith is split into a number of different houses, each led by their own shaman. Our tribe is home to many houses who have come to compete against each other for control of the faithful. This animosity cannot stand if our tribe is to succeed. We must unite the shamans under one house, so that they may work to better the entire tribe."
 shamanist_events.1.t: "Shamanist Reforms"
 shamanist_events.1.d: "The path towards reformation is one fraught with dangers and instability. The faith of our ancestors is one full of wisdom, but also carrying many problems. Instead of solving their issues, the ones who came before us passed them down. It is our duty to reform the faith and restore prosperity. The problems with our faith run deep. Even though they cause strife in the lives of our people, some have come to appreciate them. These members of our tribe will fight dearly to hold onto these problematic elements. We will bring them back into the fold, kicking and screaming if we must."
 shamanist_events.1.a: "Everything has a price."
 shamanist_events.2.t: "Vengeful Spirits"
 shamanist_events.2.d: "Our world is but one of many. Below us, the spirits of the dead enjoy a life of servitude to the Gods. Occasionally, through effort by those below or above, a crack in the earth will allow the spirits to venture into our world. While most of these spirits wish not to harm our tribe, some of them carry with them knowledge of their past lives. Our shaman speaks of a spirit similar to this. The spirit is said to be from an enemy tribe, one stuck down by our warriors in a past conflict. It has begun to terrorize the farmers of our tribe and wither their crops. If we wish to get rid of spirit we could either cast it out using a ritual or communicate with it through possession. Whatever our choice, we must put an end to this matter at once."
 shamanist_events.2.a: "Cast them away."
 shamanist_events.2.b: "Reason with them."
 shamanist_events.3.t: "Healing Ritual"
 shamanist_events.3.d: "In the corners of the heartlands, insidious threats jeopardize the faithful members of our tribe. Whether they be insects, terrible creatures, or hostile tribes, these forces of nature strike when we least expect. In times such as these, it is important to have a backup. There are some among our tribe who are gifted in the art of healing magic. Through communication with the spirits, they can protect individuals from the dangerous forces of nature. Through cooperation with these healers we could protect our tribe against any malevolent forces which might lay us low. Let us call upon their expertise to…"
 shamanist_events.3.a: "Heal our rule."
 shamanist_events.3.b: "Heal the tribe."
 shamanist_events.4.t: "House Conflict"
 shamanist_events.4.d: "Houses form the structure of our faith. Once an individual has grown accustomed to the spirits and gained the blessing of another shaman, they become a shaman themselves. Every new shaman is to found a House for their followers. The shaman performs rituals on behalf of members of the house and uses their influence over the spirits to ensure luck. Sometimes, shamans share disagreements. Depending on the severity of these conflicts, the shamans will target members of the opposing houses with their rituals. Our tribe has become the centerpoint of a great battle between the houses of some shamans. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has consulted with the wise elders of our tribe who have come up with two solutions. Either we can force the houses to stop their silly conflict directly or press them to serve the interests of our tribe as a whole together."
 shamanist_events.4.a: "Stop their plots."
 shamanist_events.4.b: "Bring them closer to our administration."
 shamanist_events.5.t: "American Flu"
 shamanist_events.5.d: "From across the waves, men bearing strange hats and skin have come to greet our tribe. At one time they brought with them gifts, but now they build great villages on the outskirts of our state. They are mostly ignorant of the spirits of this world, listening only to the influence of the Gods. Perhaps this is why they have brought such evil with them. Shortly after their arrival, many in our nation began to fall sick. The “American Flu” has ravaged our tribesmen and may soon cause the collapse of our very chieftain. In [place_where_the_american_flu_will_ravage.GetName], the pestilence has seeped into all corners of life. We must aid our brothers and sisters, before they are laid low by the work of spirits."
 shamanist_events.5.a: "Help the sick."
 shamanist_events.5.b: "There is nothing we can do!"
 shamanist_events.6.t: "The Role of the Shaman"
 shamanist_events.6.d: "In these new times of change, it is important to reevaluate the wisdom of our ancestors. For generations, our people have relied upon the shaman for protection and guidance, yet we have never really explained their precise role. Are they to be the spiritual leader, guiding the lost of our state through times of trouble and woe? Are they to be the friend of the faithful, giving a helping hand in one’s own experience of the world. Maybe they should simply be healers, a special class of pious citizens who train to manipulate the spirits and nothing more. The future shines bright for our countrymen, perhaps we should consider how it will shine for the shamans among us."
 shamanist_events.6.a: "Leader."
 shamanist_events.6.b: "Friend."
 shamanist_events.6.c: "Healer."
 shamanist_events.7.t: "Modernizing the Houses"
 shamanist_events.7.d: "One shaman to one house. This has been the way of our people ever since the dawn of man. Yet, as our tribe has grown into a proper state, the size and number of houses has grown as well. A greater population means more shamans. More shamans means more houses. More houses lead to more conflict. If we are to fend off the forces of evil and build a thriving state, we must be united under one spiritual roof. Some of the elders have spoken to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and implored [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to reform the houses. They say we must limit the number of participants and require larger houses to employ several shamans as leaders. After carefully mulling over the thought [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to…"
 shamanist_events.7.a: "Reform them."
 shamanist_events.7.b: "They are fine as they are."
 shamanist_events.8.t: "Primitive Allure"
 shamanist_events.8.d: "The ones from across the sea have done much to damage our society and bring about our downfall. First it was with their disease, the pestilence that spread across our lands and tore apart families. Then it was their greed, a different type of pestilence which led their men to rob and pillage our sacred sites. We must accept that they will always be a part of our world now. If we are to live with them, we might as well start to benefit from their presence. Among the more mystical folk of their society, some have come to appreciate the apparent “savagery” of our beliefs. Frankly, their embrace of only the Gods is something which we consider to be savage. We have told them such. Despite this, they continue to flock to our state. They bring with them luxurious gifts and knowledge of their homeland. Before we decide to scare them away, maybe we should consider what benefits cooperation could bring."
 shamanist_events.8.a: "Exploit their interest."
 shamanist_events.8.b: "Enjoy our strength."
 shamanist_events.9.t: "Faith or Ritual"
 shamanist_events.9.d: "Our world has been forever changed through the actions of those across the sea. For generations, we have been rooted firmly in our beliefs. However, some of the noise from their side of the ocean has made us consider our faith more deeply. The wisdom of our ancestors teaches us that the world can only be manipulated through the actions of spirits and rituals, but perhaps it simply requires our faith to believe in change to make it so. Some of the more radical houses in our nation have begun to teach this form of the faith, speaking on the power of the spirit within us all to impact change. Perhaps they are onto something. We must seriously consider their message and decide whether to embrace it or let it pass."
 shamanist_events.9.a: "Tradition"
 shamanist_events.9.b: "Progress"
 shamanist_events.10.t: "A Fight for Survival"
 shamanist_events.10.d: "We are now in a fight for the survival of our people. The men from across the waves have crossed a dangerous line and now threaten to take all we hold dear. They brought disease, their greed, and now war. They may have weapons we could never imagine, but we have the wisdom of the land on our side. Let us work as one cohesive unit with nature. Every shaman of the land shall conduct rituals to ensure our success. Every healer of every village shall spend day and night caring for the wounded. We cannot, we will not, let this evil win. We will resist, until the last of us falls."
 shamanist_events.10.a: "They will come to fear our strenght!"
