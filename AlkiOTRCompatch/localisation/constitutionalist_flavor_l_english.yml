 progressive_party_desc: "The Progressive Party has historically served as the most dominant party in the Union. It is focused around Regalism, a rejection of Sacramental syncretism, and encouraging progress. Due to their prominent status as one of the largest parties, the Progressives are spread throughout most of the Union but have major pockets in western California and Baja."
 traditionalist_party_desc: "The Traditionalist Party has historically served as the main counterbalance to the Progressives and the second largest party in the Union. They are focused on Populism, an embrace of Sacramental syncretism, and encouraging a return to tradition. Most traditionalists originate from Nevada, but share some significant pockets in Oregon and Baja."
 freedonian_party_desc: "The Freedonian Party is a smaller sect which originated during the Barony Crisis. Aligning more with the Traditionalist Party, the Freedonians are focused on Populism and a philosophy of praising the Spirit of Liberty through commerce called Voluntarism. Most of the Freedonian Party members have declined since the Barony crisis, but pockets still remain in the rocky mountains and Orria."
 naturalist_party_desc: "The Naturalist Party is a smaller sect which originated from different tribes in the rocky mountains. Naturalists believe that the Spirit of Liberty is especially intertwined with the earth itself and concentrates in certain areas of natural beauty. The goal of most Naturalists is to protect these areas so that the Spirit of Liberty can prosper and bless humanity for their good will. The Naturalists are mostly confined to the rocky mountains and portions of Oregon."
 blue_party_desc: "The Blue Party emerged as the Progressive equivalent party for the Despotic branch of Constitutionalism. The Blue-Red split came shortly after the Great Seer’s revelation and mainly focused on the differing opinions on what legitimacy the divine dictator draws from. The Blue Party maintains that the dictator of California is meant to be a vessel for the Founder, not any decendent of Samson."
 red_party_desc: "The Red Party was the first party to emerge from the Despotic branch of Constitutionalism with the Yellow, Green, and Blue parties later splitting off. The Red Party most closely mirrors the philosophy of the Great Seer, believing the dictator of California to be a ruler granted divine legitimacy through being a descendant of Samson."
 yellow_party_desc: "The Yellow Party is a sect of the Despotic branch of Constitutionalism which functions as a Freedonian equivalent. The Yellow Party continues to follow the same tenets of Voluntarism and Populism of the Freedonians while also exposing that the dictator of California represents the divine embodiment of the Spirit of Liberty. This dictator is said to emerge as the wealthiest man in the Union who will take his place on the throne after besting all others in the marketplace. Before the day of his arrival, the Yellow Party rulers must work to ensure that they live in his image and amass as much wealth as possible."
 green_party_desc: "The Green Party is a sect of the Despotic branch of Constitutionalism which functions as a Naturalist equivalent. The Green Party shares the same belief in a universal Spirit of Liberty as the Naturalist party, but believe that the Founder will send down a divine individual to conquer the lands of California and act as a warden of the parks. This dictator will have an absolute rule, and it is up to the Green Party rulers to prepare the lands for his arrival."
 actionist_party_desc: "The Actionist Party is a sect of the Anarchist branch of Constitutionalism which functions as a Progressive equivalent. The Actionist Party differs from the rest of their Anarchist brethren in their belief that the Spirit of Liberty desires an ordered world instead of an inherently chaotic one. This expresses itself in their desire for centralization and society rather than a formless mob."
 constitutionalist_party_desc: "The Constitutionalist Party is a sect of Anarchism which functions as a Traditionalist equivalent. Their name comes from the early Anarchists who proclaimed themselves as “True Constitutionalists'' for their belief in the universal Spirit of Liberty. Constitutionalists practice the strictest form of Anarchism, fashioning their societies into formless mobs of desire based on the wishes of the Spirit of Liberty."
 goldencrat_party_desc: "The Goldencrat Party emerged a Freedonian alternative to the mainline Anarchic branches of Actionism and Constitutionalism. The Goldencrat hyper-Voluntarism promotes commerce between individuals as the highest good. This is expressed in a decentralized society built on notions of shared wealth and individual power."
 protectioner_party_desc: "The Protectioner Party emerged as a sect of the Anarchist branch of Constitutionalism that functioned as a Naturalist equivalent. The Protectionists broke from the Naturalists due to the supposed role of the Spirit of Liberty, with Protectionists believing that the Spirit will naturally prevent the people from destroying the divine lands."

 partisan_events.1.t: "Union Day Jubilee"
 partisan_events.1.d: "Union Day commemorates the founding of our glorious confederation. Centuries before the American Empire’s foundation, the warlords of California created the union over an elaborate banquet. Ever since, this occasion has been celebrated with lavish parades in almost every duchy. The largest of these celebrations comes every quarter century during which rulers from throughout the Union gather into a single city. These “Jubilee Union Days” are elaborately planned affairs which are specifically delegated to a single ruler. As the president of the union, we are given the task of selecting who will host this Jubilee. Selecting from one of the electors, a member of our own party, or even taking on the task ourselves could make the festival more likely to succeed. However, we must acknowledge that if we were to host a poor event, it would likely reflect badly on our state for the foreseeable future. Declaring any wars or stirring any controversy would likely ruin our chances at hosting a proper union day and tarnish our reputation in the minds of the many."
 partisan_events.1.a: "I will host it myself!"
 partisan_events.1.b: "Maybe one of the electors?"
 partisan_events.1.c: "One of our colleges."
 partisan_events.1.e: "Let the fates decide."
 partisan_events.1.f: "We will not fund these lavish wastes"
 hosting_union_day_desc.tt: "We will be required to host the Union Day Jubilee. By selecting different event options we can either move towards a §Gpositive§! or §Rnegative§! outcome. If we enter war during this time, we will lose this priveledge and the emperor will have to select another realm. The festival is set to begin in §YAugust§!."

 partisan_events.2.t: "Tapped for Union Day Jubilee"
 partisan_events.2.d: "We have been tapped by the president of our glorious union to host this Jubilee Union Day. Union Day commemorates the founding of our glorious confederation. Centuries before the American Empire’s foundation, the warlords of California created the union over an elaborate banquet. Ever since, this occasion has been celebrated with lavish parades in almost every duchy. The largest of these celebrations comes every quarter century during which rulers from throughout the Union gather into a single city. These “Jubilee Union Days” are elaborately planned affairs which are specifically delegated to a single ruler. While this task may seem to be a glorious one, it should be noted that it will come with difficulty. If we were to declare war or stir up too much controversy, this festival could be ruined. Ruining a Jubilee Union Day would leave a lasting poor impression in the minds of our union brethren, so we must be careful in our planning."
 partisan_events.2.a: "A heavy responsibility."
 partisan_events.3.t: "Wine From Where?"
 partisan_events.3.d: "Every festival needs a selection of drinks and Union Day is no different. The refined pallet of our union brethren necessitates that we chose a high quality wine, but from where? Traditionally, the Napan wines have served as a symbol of Californian quality and craftsmanship. However, their status and proximity make them a standard affair at nearly every celebration. The wines of the Willamette valley are similar, highly prized abroad but freely available within the union. While selecting either of these choices would likely please their respective dukes, they are unlikely to truly wow the attendees. A more expensive option could be the foreign Italian wine. Importing wine from the peninsula would certainly set us apart from those who planned the festival before us and go far in making this Jubilee one to remember. Of course, if this is all too costly, we could always forgo the traditional drink and make up for its loss in another area."
 partisan_events.3.a: "Napan of course."
 partisan_events.3.b: "I hear Willamette has nice wines."
 partisan_events.3.c: "Something foreign, Italia perhaps."
 partisan_events.3.e: "A dry festival."

 this_will_impact_the_festivals_quality_bad.tt: "This will §Rnegatively§! impact the outcome of the festival."
 partisan_events.4.t: "Foreign Guests"
 partisan_events.4.d: "Inviting foreign guests to the Jubilee is always a tricky business. Of course, if we were to have a foreign king attend it would boost the status of our festival, but their response to the invitation could cause a level of controversy among the different dukes. Festivals in the past have served as the perfect opportunity to craft treaties and alliances with foreign monarchs. In particular, Jesus of the Salt Lake and his American Empire formalized their union with the Californians during the Jubilee of ‘83. Enriching our own status in the face of a powerful monarch and creating a lasting legacy from this Jubilee might be an opportunity too valuable for us to skip out on."
 partisan_events.4.a: "Open the invitation!"
 partisan_events.4.b: "This is our day."
 we_reach_out_to_a_powerful_nation.tt: "We will reach out to [foreign_guest_for_uoc.GetName]."
 partisan_events.5.t: "An invitation to union day"
 partisan_events.5.d: "We have received an invitation to a festival in the Union of California. The festival in question marks “Union Day” a celebration of the founding of their Union. Typically the president of California selects a particular duke to host this festival, and it just so happens that this duke has reached out to our monarch. Attending such a festival would no doubt make many members of the union happy with our presence, however would grant nothing for us in return. Politely denying their request would prevent any controversy while sending back an insult would do the opposite. While it certainly is none of our concern, maybe we should indulge their request. "
 partisan_events.5.a: "I will attend."
 partisan_events.5.b: "Kindly reject their offer."
 partisan_events.5.c: "An insult!"
 honored_by_our_attendence.tt: "§YEvery nation in the UOC§! opinion changed of §Y[Root.GetName]§! by §G+25§!"
 partisan_events.6.t: "Foreign invitation drama"
 partisan_events.6.d: "The response from our foreign ruler has arrived and it is very disappointing. Not only was our request denied, but this ruler has insulted Union Day itself. Many dukes have already begun to draft letters to rebuke the nation. This whole affair has created a cloud of controversy which overshadows our festival. It is likely that this will have a negative impact on the way Jubilee is perceived."
 partisan_events.6.a: "Horror!"
 partisan_events.7.t: "A Polite Decline"
 partisan_events.7.d: "The response from our foreign ruler has arrived and it is slightly disappointing. It came in a simple parcel and contained a polite rejection to our invitation. While it will likely have no bearing on our festival, the fact that the rejection was not more scornful has many of our advisors breathing a sigh of relief. With all the difficulty that comes with planning such an elaborate festival, adding on the controversy of foreign politics could have proved entirely disastrous."
 partisan_events.7.a: "Disappointing, but not a disaster."
 partisan_events.8.t: "A Positive Response"
 partisan_events.8.d: "The response from our foreign ruler has arrived and it is exciting. It came in a simple parcel and contained a brief acceptance to our invitation. Being among such rarified air at this Jubilee will surely make it one to remember. News of their attendance has already begun to spread throughout the union and is generating a lot of excitement for this year's Jubilee. We must work diligently now to ensure that this ruler does not come to regret their decision."
 partisan_events.8.a: "Perfect!"
 partisan_events.9.t: "Crafting a Speech"
 partisan_events.9.d: "Speeches are an important part of Constitutionalism. In a usual speech, the speaker communes with the spirit of liberty and reveals the founder’s will. However, only priests, representatives, and others who have devoted their lives to the constitution are able to connect to the spirit of liberty in such a way. During the Jubilee, a ceremonial speech is given by the hosting duke which is meant to mirror one given by the constitutionally inclined. These speeches are often used to state a ruler’s loyalty to a particular view on the constitution. We could either bolster our own liberalism or diminish it depending on what we chose to focus on. Let us make sure that whatever it is, it serves the founder above."
 partisan_events.9.a: "For the people!"
 partisan_events.9.b: "For the monarchs!"
 partisan_events.9.c: "Lets keep politics out of it."
 partisan_events.10.t: "Necessary Entertainment"
 partisan_events.10.d: "Every celebration needs some sort of entertainment and the Jubilee is no different. The festival is one of the largest gatherings of artists, inventors, and all manner of talent for the sole reason of entertaining the different dukes of the Union. Typically, spaces will need to be prepared for all of these different talents to be displayed which costs an incredible amount. Artists need walls for their pieces, actors need a stage to perform, and athletes need a field to run. While preparing all of this would set us up for a traditional festival, we could go beyond the norm and attempt to provide something more exotic. Several of our advisors have pitched the idea of a unique zoo with animals from across the American and Mexican continents. Lions from Michigan, Floridian elephants, and arctic bears would truly stun the festival guests and set our Jubilee apart from all others."
 partisan_events.10.a: "The standard affair."
 partisan_events.10.b: "We must have the most exotic animals"
 partisan_events.10.c: "I am the entertainment."
 partisan_events.11.t: "Accomodations"
 partisan_events.11.d: "The inevitable presence of so many people in our realm necessitates that we provide accommodations for all of them. Not only will dukes be arriving, but also rich nobles, foreign travelers, and party representatives. Catering to all of these different people would be incredibly expensive, so perhaps it would be best if we picked a particular group to focus on. If we were to keep it equal, the quality of accommodations would be standard even for the monarchs who are more accustomed to wealth. On the other hand if we were to give special accommodations to the nobles we would likely bolster our own liberalism. Finally, if we wanted to spend an exorbitant amount, we could give equally pristine accommodations to the nobles and the paupers. Having such lavish conditions would likely improve our festival above others, but would have no bearing on our liberalism."
 partisan_events.11.a: "Keep it equal."
 partisan_events.11.b: "The finest quarters for the nobles."
 partisan_events.11.c: "Why not both?"
 partisan_events.11.e: "We have plenty of tents."
 partisan_events.12.t: "A Standard Festival"
 partisan_events.12.d: "The first day of the Jubilee Union Day festival has arrived and gone off with a great celebration. Traditionalists joined hands with Progressives and Naturalists with Freedonians. For the first time in twenty five years, the Union has come together as children of the founder. In the joyous music and sounds of celebration the faint whisper of Jubilees past can be heard. We have done well to carry out this time honored tradition and will be remembered for the foreseeable future. While there were certainly areas where we could have improved the status of the festival, what we have done is deserving of some praise. With it all behind us now we can finally rest and enjoy what we have created. Cheers, for the Union!"
 partisan_events.12.a: "At least we survived."
 partisan_events.13.t: "An Excellent Festival"
 partisan_events.13.d: "The first day of the Jubilee Union Day festival has arrived and gone off with an unprecedented celebration. Traditionalists joined hands with Progressives and Naturalists with Freedonians. For the first time in twenty five years, the Union has come together as children of the founder. In the joyous music and sounds of celebration the faint whisper of Jubilees past can be heard. Our preparation for this festival has turned it into one for the history books. For generations, this festival will be remembered for its beauty and significance. While our role in that process may soon fade, we truly left a legacy for future planners.  With it all behind us now we can finally rest and enjoy what we have created. Cheers, for the Union!"
 partisan_events.13.a: "A jolly time."
 partisan_events.14.t: "A Terrible Festival"
 partisan_events.14.d: "The first day of the Jubilee Union Day festival has arrived and ended with a lukewarm reaction. Our poor planning has led to many dukes to be disappointed with our festival. There are whispers now of many planning to leave early at the crack of dawn. In the deafening silence of this lackluster night the disappointment is almost audible. While this festival will be forgotten to history soon enough, we must bear the consequences of our own actions for the foreseeable future. We have tarnished this sacred tradition, may the founder forgive us."
 partisan_events.14.a: "What a shame"
 partisan_events.15.t: "Festival Called Off"
 partisan_events.15.d: "Due to the current state of affairs the festival must be called off. It is an unenviable circumstance to cancel our hosting of the festival, but potentially bringing war to this tradition is something we cannot afford. Luckily, the process of selecting another festival host will begin in the season leading up to next year’s festival."
 partisan_events.15.a: "At least we survived"
 partisan_events.17.t: "Choose a Party"
 partisan_events.17.d: "Parsianity contains a number of different unique sects, known as parties, which each adhere to a different interpretation of the Constitution. Among these are the Progressive, Traditionalist, Freedonian, and Naturalist parties. Not having a party alienates us from the rest of the Partisan world, we must select one in order to ensure that we do not fall behind."

 partisan_events.19.d: "Anarchism contains a number of different unique sects, known as parties, which each adhere to a different interpretation of the Constitution. Among these are the Actionist, Constitutionalist, Goldencrat, and Protectioner parties. Not having a party alienates us from the rest of the Partisan world, we must select one in order to ensure that we do not fall behind."

 partisan_events.19.c: "The Goldencrat Party"
 partisan_events.19.e: "The Protectioner Party"
 partisan_events.20.t: "Despotic Reformation"
 partisan_events.20.d: "Most quieted down as they gathered around their brave leader’s podium. He tapped his foot sheepishly and then spoke aloud. He spoke of their victories, and also their losses. He spoke of their history and their ancestors. Then, he spoke of Samson. He spoke of Samson’s gift to him, Samson’s special gift. The crowd looked around, befuddled at what he meant. The unread and unwashed masses had never heard of a special gift given by Samson, they could never fully understand their brave leader’s great abilities. He told them of his divine sight, he told them that he saw the spirits of evil surrounding them. At this point, much of the crowd stood in fear, but the ruler slyly curled his fist and told them not to be afraid. He told them that he would protect them, that he would rule over them, that he would never let the spirits come for them. The crowd burst into applause and cheers rang throughout the city’s streets. News of the Great Seer spread like wildfire. Many have begun to devote themselves to this brave man, it might be wise for us to do the same."
 partisan_events.20.a: "Interesting."
 partisan_events.21.t: "Anarchist Reformation"
 partisan_events.21.d: "The council of Orria is one of the most conservative portions of the Traditionalist party. Founded during the “War of The Mad'' centuries ago, they gained popularity for their dire calls for Nevada’s independence. Throughout the 15th century, they have steadily gained popularity as a collection of supremely gifted intellectuals. They founded universities throughout the territory of Nevada in order to advance their own freedom focused thought. With the rise of the Despotic movement in the west, many Nevadans have begun to feel threatened by the power hungry dukes of Sunkissed. Some of the most radical members of the Despotic movement have even begun to call for a total abolition of the Constitution in favor of a dictatorship. The first response from this situation came from the Council of Orria, which drafted a short manifesto proclaiming the tenets of the Nevadan Partisan Tradition, giving it the name Anarchism."
 partisan_events.21.a: "Interesting."
 partisan_events.22.t: "Despots Flock to Our State"
 partisan_events.22.d: "Due to the words of the Heretical Seer, a horrible plague has come to spread across this land. These so-called “Despots” have taken a liking to our state due to our very high liberalism. They now flock to our borders in droves and infiltrate our lands like rats. They grow communities and spread their heretical word wherever they go. We must snuff out their presence to ensure that none of our fair realm are led astray. In the name of the Founder, we must stop the Despots."
 partisan_events.22.a: "Interesting"
 partisan_events.23.t: "Anarchists Flock to Our State"
 partisan_events.23.d: "Due to that decree passed by the Orrian Council we now have another problem on our plate. The so-called “Anarchists'' have taken a liking to our state due to our very low liberalism. They now flock to our borders in droves and infiltrate our land like ants. The nameless formless mob consumes more of the Founder’s noble flock each day. If left unchecked, the entire union will collapse into this formless state. We must do something to stop it and end this perverse corruption of liberty!"
 partisan_events.23.a: "Interesting"
 partisan_events.24.t: "Heresy of the Great Seer"
 partisan_events.24.d: "The actions of the Great Seer have caused a serious disturbance in the Partisan peace. Their philosophy of despotism and continued insistence on an all powerful dictator has left many uneasy and unwilling to compromise with our administration. We must do something in order to remedy this situation. Although the Great Seer attempts to keep their identity under wraps, both literally and figuratively, it would not be difficult to find out which individual is responsible for starting this movement. If we were to try this figure before a collection of party representatives and priests we would no doubt anger the despots and set a hard boundary against any sort of heresy. Parsianity must remain whole if the union is to endure, we must do something!"
 partisan_events.24.a: "Death is the only fitting punishment!"
 partisan_events.24.b: "Imprison him!"
 partisan_events.24.c: "What crime did he commit?"
 partisan_events.25.t: "End of the Reformation"
 partisan_events.25.d: "The heresies of Despotism and Anarchism have begun to slow in their spread. While our union is ravaged, there is still the opportunity for recovery. As we adjust to the world as it will come to be, let us remember that this is not the way that it should be. Rather, this state of affairs is a perversion of the norm. The Founder is no doubt disappointed in his children, but will guide us to the right path forward. Let the spirit of liberty flow through every man, woman, and child of the rightly guided faith! Even if they are not ready for our light, they cannot remain in the dark."
 partisan_events.25.a: "We will recover."
 partisan_events.26.t: "Constitutionalist Debate"
 partisan_events.26.d: "The Constitution is the founding document of the Constitutionalist faith. While the Ogdonian Bible does have some influence on many local practices, the Constitution is considered the primary document from which the members of the Constitutionalist faith derive their belief. It tells the tale of the Founder’s creation of the universe and his gift of the Spirit of Liberty unto man. The most important part of the Constitution is its “amendments” which contain a list of different laws which man is meant to follow. However, the interpretation of these amendments and the role of the Spirit of Liberty have continuously served as a subject for debate amongst the various religious scholars of our realm. This is the situation we now find ourselves in, as some of our own advisors bicker about the true legitimacy of the monarch in relation to the Spirit of Liberty. The Regalist approach is that the monarchs of the union are rightly selected by the Founder as servants of the Spirit of Liberty while the Populist approach states that the monarchs are in power to serve the Spirit of Liberty that exists the same amongst all people. Our position on the matter should be made clear so that more debate does not impact the effectiveness of our rule."
 partisan_events.26.a: "The answer is with the people!"
 partisan_events.26.b: "The answer is in the state!"
 partisan_events.27.t: "Populist Administration"
 partisan_events.27.d: "Many within our realm have come to question what party we truly are. While our party generally tends towards a Populist interpretation of the constitution, our own state has come to adopt a more Regalist one. In times such as these, we must decide for ourselves how to proceed. Shall we change our party to one which fits in with our beliefs more philosophically or perhaps strike a new path in our own party? Whatever the choice, let it be in the plan of the founder and through the will of the Spirit of Liberty."
 partisan_events.27.a: "We will embrace it!"
 partisan_events.27.b: "Never!"
 partisan_events.28.t: "Regalist Administration"
 partisan_events.28.d: "Many within our realm have come to question what party we truly are. While our party generally tends towards a Regalist interpretation of the constitution, our own state has come to adopt a more Populist one. In times such as these, we must decide for ourselves how to proceed. Shall we change our party to one which fits in with our beliefs more philosophically or perhaps strike a new path in our own party? Whatever the choice, let it be in the plan of the founder and through the will of the Spirit of Liberty."
 partisan_events.28.a: "We will embrace it!"
 partisan_events.28.b: "Never!"
 partisan_events.29.t: "Trade Intervention"
 partisan_events.29.d: "Just like most aspects of Constitutionalist life, liberalism plays a heavy role in commerce. The Constitution describes the act of free Commerce between different parties as being an essential aspect of Liberty' through several different stories. This is often held up by merchants as a reason for the unrestricted trade of goods without any sort of regal oversight. Despite this, many different representatives and priests justify the intervention of commerce under the Regalist view of a monarch as an absolute authority on matters of the Spirit. A wealthy baron of our own realm has crafted a lucrative trade deal, if we wish to intervene now would be the time."
 partisan_events.29.a: "We must intervene."
 partisan_events.29.b: "Let the market decide."
 partisan_events.30.t: "War Time Disorganization"
 partisan_events.30.d: "Our nation is at war, yet many in our realm are still hung up on different types of pedantic disagreements. Under traditional Regalist thought, the monarch of the state is right to war with whomever he wills. Populist teachings espouse that monarchs are only inclined to war against those who the holy spirit deems necessary. This is, as is the case often with Populist teachings, expressed through the opinion of the public. Outside of the declaration of war, Regalists and Populists even differ on the role of the monarch in the unenviable details of combat. Regalists maintain that the ruler is to face the enemy himself and be the sole authority on battle, while Populists espouse that a complex series of generals who can check the monarch are necessary to prevent tyranny. Siding with one of these interpretations during this time of war could grant us benefits and better define our realm’s status."
 partisan_events.30.a: "We must take charge."
 partisan_events.30.b: "Hire more talent."
 partisan_events.31.t: "Legitimate Problems"
 partisan_events.31.d: "Under Regalist teachings our monarch is meant to act as a powerful spokesperson for the Founder through the Spirit of Liberty. However, there are many in our own state who do not see this in our monarch. The illegitimacy of our ruler has led many to lean more towards the Populist mindset. Throughout the realm, common people have begun to make decisions outside of our monarch’s reach. Whether this is something to be celebrated or feared is up to us to decide."
 partisan_events.31.a: "We must take charge."
 partisan_events.32.t: "Iron Will"
 partisan_events.32.d: "Under Regalist teachings our monarch is meant to act as a powerful spokesperson for the Founder through the Spirit of Liberty. By this metric, we have reached a resounding success. The words of our monarch extend beyond the borders of our state in their power and influence. When our ruler speaks, the people of our realm listen. Due to our leader’s high legitimacy we now have moved towards a path of greater Liberalism. Whether this is something to be celebrated or feared is up to us to decide."
 partisan_events.32.a: "I am the state."
 partisan_events.33.t: "Order of the Stone Crown"
 partisan_events.33.d: "The Order of The Stone Crown emerged during the 10th century from the heightened level of Liberalism during the long presidency of the Francisco realm. Founded originally in the Big Sur by a number of different Progressive representatives, the Order of The Stone Crown was based on the traditions of the old Imperial Kernifornians. The order wormed its way throughout most of the Union and has now prompted our nation for a formal partnership. The Order would be allowed to function within our realm and would periodically assist us in our own rule if we were to embrace them. With their ancient legacy at our back we would move forward towards a more Regalist administration, but perhaps that is for the best."
 partisan_events.33.a: "We accept their ancient legitimacy."
 partisan_events.33.b: "I am the state."
 partisan_events.34.t: "Stone Crown sends a champion"
 partisan_events.34.d: "The Order of The Stone Crown has sent us one of their own champions. Members of The Order are renowned for their capabilities in combat. During the War of the Mad, The Order of the Stone Crown assisted the Napan Presidency in defeating the mad king Lewis. During the defense of Baja against the Arizonian Catholics, The Order defeated thousands of crusaders at the battle of Ensenada. It is due to the Order’s rigorous training and expert soldiers that the Union did not fall years ago. We will graciously accept their champion and use them to support our own forces."
 partisan_events.34.a: "Wonderful."
 partisan_events.35.t: "Stone Crown sends volunteers"
 partisan_events.35.d: "The Order of The Stone Crown has sent us some of their finest warriors to assist us in any conflict we might find ourselves in. The Order has routinely granted their aid to many different monarchs in exchange for safety to function within their state. When The Order was originally founded in the Big Sur, they were rejected by the then realm of Robles and forced to flee northward into Francisco. The President welcomed them into his kingdom and allowed them to establish their own headquarters in San Francisco. The Order paid back the president just a few years later when they assisted him in suppressing a major civil revolt in the Joaquin. Just as the president once graciously accepted the Order’s assistance, we too shall take their aid with wide grins."
 partisan_events.35.a: "Wonderful"
 partisan_events.36.t: "The Everyman Band"
 partisan_events.36.d: "The Everyman Band was a coalition of different Populist representatives and priests founded during the 10th century in response to the growing Regalist trend in California. Originally from Oregon, the Everyman band rose to prominence in their great procession across the Union. From Seattle to Vegas, the band visited nearly every city along their route and spread the word of Populism. Through the centuries, the Everyman Band has come to represent more of a particular bend towards artistry and innovation in addition to their earlier Populist thought. Now the band reaches out to our state. In exchange for letting them exist within our realm they will enrich our court with different pieces of art and their newest discoveries. This will likely give our administration its own Populist bend, but perhaps it is for the best."
 partisan_events.36.a: "We will join their band!"
 partisan_events.36.b: "Heresy!"
 partisan_events.37.t: "Everyman Band Sends Talent"
 partisan_events.37.d: "The Everyman band has done well to enrich our court with all manner of art, but now they have outdone themselves. In lieu of the usual paintings or sculpture, the Everyman band has sent us some of their own talent. For generations, the Everyman Band has been an organization that creates some of the most innovative and moving art. Members of the band have created some of the most recognizable pieces in the Californian cannon. With an artist of our own, we can only hope that now we may become a part of this rich tradition."
 partisan_events.37.a: "May they enrich our culture!"
 partisan_events.38.t: "Everyman Band Offers Invention"
 partisan_events.38.d: "California has long been a hub for the world’s innovation. From the times of Antiquity when California was the premiere civilization on the American continent until the rise of the Francisco presidency, the Union has been on the forefront of human discovery. Yet during the relatively dark middle ages, this innovation came to fade. It was only with the rude awakening that was The War of The Mad that the Union once again began to innovate. The Everyman band has been the center of this innovation ever since. Just today they have shared some of their knowledge with us, we must be wise and embrace their advances."
 partisan_events.38.a: "A bountiful gift!"
 partisan_events.40.t: "Local Priest Speaks Heresy"
 partisan_events.40.d: "Our nation has become swamped in controversy over the comment of a local priest. Speeches are an important part of Constitutionalism. In a usual speech, the speaker communes with the Spirit of Liberty and reveals the founder’s will. Priests, Representatives, and others spend their lives attempting to hone this skill of speaking through the Spirit of Liberty. In a speech to his congregation a local priest preached a thought which is widely considered to be heretical amongst most Constitutionalist scholars. Many throughout the nation are calling for this priest’s imprisonment, but others acknowledge that it might just be a mistake from an inexperienced speaker. In order to put this controversy to bed, we must make a statement and follow through with the consequences."
 partisan_events.40.a: "Reprimand him."
 partisan_events.40.b: "It was a simple mistake."
 partisan_events.41.t: "The Court Movement"
 partisan_events.41.d: "A new philosophy has begun to spread throughout the Constitutionalist world: Judicialism. The so-called “Court Movement” sprung up from the minds of several Populist priests. It espouses that the monarch is meant to be checked by a council of trained speakers known as judges. This philosophy is not entirely new, originally being based on the judges of Jerusalem who transcribed the Constitution and created the amendments. Its rise to prominence has caused our state quite a bit of trouble, as many attempt to have our own monarch restricted by such a body. While establishing a court would go far in appeasing these dissidents, it would heavily move our state in a populist direction. Whether that is something to be celebrated or feared is up to you to decide."
 partisan_events.41.a: "We will found a national court."
 partisan_events.41.b: "We reject such a premise"
 partisan_events.42.t: "Judicial Rebels"
 partisan_events.42.d: "Our state has become plagued with a set of violent Judicial dissidents. They wished only for our monarch to be reduced to ruin and made the lapdog of some court of corrupt priests. We must ensure that this does not come to pass. If it takes crushing every last one of the dissidents, let it be to the glory of the Founder."
 partisan_events.42.a: "Crush them!"
 partisan_events.43.t: "Court Rules Against Monarch"
 partisan_events.43.d: "Our judiciary has ruled against our monarch. One of the actions which our leader has taken led was deemed against the will of the Spirit of Liberty and so we have been rebuked spiritually. This action has led to a great loss of Liberalism amongst our administration as many of our advisors turn to Populist waves of thought. Whether this is something to be feared or to be celebrated is up to you to decide."
 partisan_events.43.a: "Damn the Justices"
 partisan_events.44.t: "Court Rules in Favor of Monarch"
 partisan_events.44.d: "Our judiciary has ruled in favor of our monarch. One of the actions which our leader has taken was challenged by a party representative and cleared by the court. This has done much to move us towards Regalism. Much of our nation now looks to our ruler as the divine source of revelation. Whether this is something to be feared or to be celebrated is up to you to decide."
 partisan_events.44.a: "As they should."
 partisan_events.45.t: "Court Curbs Power of Monarch"
 partisan_events.45.d: "Our judiciary has officially rebuked our monarch. Beyond ruling an action of our monarch to be against the will of the Spirit of Liberty, they have officially stated that our monarch does not carry the spirit within themselves. This has already begun to rapidly deteriorate our liberalism amongst the populace. With the judiciary officially saying our monarch is without divine inheritance, most citizens are looking to their community leaders and themselves for guidance on Constitutional issues. Whether this is something to be feared or to be celebrated is up to you to decide."

 partisan_events.51.d: "The Progessive Party has long held power over most of the Union. It is mostly defined by its rejection of Sacramental syncretism, its Regalist focus, and its advocacy for progress. Progressive aligned monarchs often lean towards the elevation of their dynasties as a way of securing their status. Nowhere is this better displayed than in Oakland Hall, which features an updated list of all of the emperors of the Union of California dating back to the confederation’s founding. Many different Progressive aligned realms have constructed similar lists of ancestral rulers to commemorate their legacy. If we were to construct one of our own, it would no doubt merge with our Progressive identity and remind the subjects of our realm of our divine importance."
 partisan_events.51.a: "May we be remembered forever."
 partisan_events.51.b: "Unecesary."
 partisan_events.52.t: "Checking the Balance"
 partisan_events.52.d: "The Traditionalist Party has been the second largest party in the Union ever since its founding. It is mostly defined by its embrace of Sacramental syncretism, its Populist focus, and its advocacy for tradition. Tradition in this sense is defined by the traditional role of the Union and its subsequent redefinition under Samson’s intervention. During these periods, the President of the union and the monarchs of the realms were barely involved in the lives of the common citizen. Their tyranny was kept in check by a series of different advisors, priests, and lords. Considering we are a part of this great tradition, it would be wise for us to select one of these paths in order to prevent our progeny from becoming too powerful."
 partisan_events.52.a: "Create a royal advisory."
 partisan_events.52.b: "Hand power to the lords."
 partisan_events.52.c: "Give the priests power."
 partisan_events.53.t: "Funding the Companies"
 partisan_events.53.d: "The Freedonian Party was founded during the height of the Barony Crisis and came to dominate Union politics. In its current state, it has lost much of its influence and is relegated to a few states in Nevada and along the rockies. Despite this, Freedonian aligned realms still manage to attract all manner of respectable businessmen who wish to invest in their prosperity. We have recently been approached by a small company of men wishing to trade and manufacture goods within our realm. Giving them a payment out of our royal coffers would go far in affirming our identity as part of the Freedonian party."
 partisan_events.53.a: "A worth exchange."
 partisan_events.53.b: "They waste our resources."
 partisan_events.54.t: "Setting Aside Naturalist Land"
 partisan_events.54.d: "The Naturalist Party was founded during the early days of the empire by a collection of different mountainous tribes. In their fringe view, they believe that the Spirit of Liberty inhabits all aspects of nature and it is up to the leaders of various realms to protect the land from the actions of the people. Part of achieving this goal is establishing protected areas which cannot be used by citizens and will remain to the Spirit of Liberty. One of our own provinces would serve as a perfect fit for one of these divine parks. While it would grant us powerful legitimacy amongst our citizens and realm, it will become incredibly difficult to exploit the province’s resources. Ultimately the choice should be in the service of the Spirit of Liberty."
 partisan_events.54.a: "This is a wonderous cause!"
 partisan_events.54.b: "But this land is necesarry"
 partisan_events.55.t: "Absolute Rule"
 partisan_events.55.d: "The Blue Party was founded shortly after the foundation of the Despotic movement as a response to the mainstream Red Party’s philosophy. While it still argued for the ascension of an absolute dictator to the presidential office, they rejected the Samsonian roots of the argument. Instead, the blue party centers their philosophy on the idea that the dictator is a vessel for the literal spirit of the founder. Those that assist in the dictator’s ascension are then given the most divine legitimacy. This has not been lost on our people, who have allowed us to take a stronger role in their lives and moved towards a more Regalist mindset."
 partisan_events.55.a: "A worthy exchange"
 partisan_events.56.t: "Samson's Legacy"
 partisan_events.56.d: "The Red Party was founded by the followers of the Great Seer in accordance with his teachings. The party stresses the need for a divinely gifted dictator to ascend to the throne of the Union and claim absolute rule over all of California. The Great Seer was given their own sight supposedly through Samson, who they claim was the son of The Founder given human flesh. This has continuously troubled many of the Despots, who come from the Progressive tradition of Sacramental distinction. Our realm must now decide if we are to brand ourselves as descendants of the true son of the Founder or just children of his creation."
 partisan_events.56.a: "Embrace the Sacramental Roots"
 partisan_events.56.b: "We are heirs to none other than the founder above"
 partisan_events.57.t: "Powerful Greed"
 partisan_events.57.d: "The Yellow Party was founded shortly after the creation of the Despotic movement as a response to the mainstream Red Party’s philosophy. In particular, the Yellow Party espouses that the divine dictator who is meant to control all of California is to be drawn from the trader class. Specifically, the dictator is meant to be the richest man in the union. Realms which are Yellow Party adjacent typically attempt to enrich themselves to reach this status. However, in our own attempts we have found ourselves at war against a fierce adversary. We are left with the decision to either spend some of our own wealth or face destruction."
 partisan_events.57.a: "It is necesarry for our survival."
 partisan_events.57.b: "Improve training."
 partisan_events.58.t: "Enforcing Naturalism"
 partisan_events.58.d: "The Green Party was created shortly after the foundation of the Despotic movement as a response to the mainstream Red Party’s philosophy. The Greens advocate for the divine dictator of the Union to protect all parts of the realm which are meant for the Spirit of Liberty. This has often led states which align with the Green Party to rapidly expand into the areas which are meant to be protected. In order to fully live up to our status as a member of the Green Party, it would be wise for us to lay claim to those lands the Founder intends for us to protect."
 partisan_events.58.a: "We will crush the pollutors."
 partisan_events.59.t: "Centralizing The Mob"
 partisan_events.59.d: "The Actionist Party broke off from the Constitutionalist Mob during the early days of Anarchism. The main difference in ideology came from many former Progressives which attempted to centralize the mob into something which could be better managed. Instead, they were bitterly resisted and removed from the central body. As a member of this tradition, we should attempt to do what our predecessors failed to accomplish. Choosing a city, either the capital or a place where the mob has gathered, we can work towards developing and turning the mob into a more robust structure of a state."
 partisan_events.59.a: "Push forward the capital."
 partisan_events.59.b: "Let the mob decide."
 partisan_events.60.t: "Question of the spirit's nature"
 partisan_events.60.d: "The Constitutionalist Party originated from the dawn of Anarchism following the main tenets expressed by the Orrian manifesto. Specifically, the Constitutionalists believe that the Spirit of Liberty resides in every person and that every citizen should act as they desire according to the Spirit’s guidance. This is the generally accepted idea, yet there are many who disagree on the exact specifics. The Universalists believe that the Spirit of Liberty inhabits all things, including the land and its animals. The Selectivists believe that only man holds the Spirit, while others believe that only those who had joined the mob. As a member of this tradition, we must make our stance clear on the issue to prevent confusion and infighting."
 partisan_events.60.a: "It is within everyone and everything."
 partisan_events.60.b: "It is only within the founder's children."
 partisan_events.60.c: "It is only within the founder's chosen children."
 partisan_events.61.t: "Share the Wealth"
 partisan_events.61.d: "The Goldencrat Party originated shortly after the publication of the Orrian manifesto as an alternative interpretation of the Anarchist philosophy. Instead of advocating for a completely stateless society, the Goldencrats believe that the role of the realm’s monarch should be to amass wealth and spread their earned prosperity among all of their citizens. Taking after their tradition, we should be inclined to do the same. By sharing our wealth amongst the people, we will ensure that the Spirit of Liberty prevails against all odds."
 partisan_events.61.a: "It is our duty!"
 partisan_events.61.b: "Expensive."
 partisan_events.62.t: "Tragedy of the Mob"
 partisan_events.62.d: "The Protectionist Party originated as a response to the Orrian manifesto in various Naturalist circles. While they sharply criticized the actions of the Constitutionalist and Actionist mobs, the Protectionists did adopt some of their decentralized practices in order to better preserve the divine parks. However, without greater regal oversight to protect the parks, many exploited their bountiful resources. This same pattern repeats itself in our very state. We must act quickly to prevent this tragedy of the mob from destroying the lands of The Spirit."
