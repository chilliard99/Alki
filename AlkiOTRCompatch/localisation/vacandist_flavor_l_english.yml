 vacandist_rebels_title: "Vacandist Zealot"
 vacandist_rebels_name: "Vacandist Zealots"
 vacandist_rebels_desc: "These rebels are radical Vacandists which desire for our state to follow their crooked outlook."
 vacandist_rebels_army: "Zealot Army"
 VACANDIST_ASPECTS_LONG: "Vacandist Aspect"
 VACANDIST_ASPECTS_SHORT: "aspect"
 promoted_solo_ecclesia_vaca: "Promoted Solo Ecclesia"
 interfaith_chuch_vaca: "Interfaith Church"
 local_conclavism_vaca: "Local Conclavism"
 desc_local_conclavism_vaca: "Following the line of logic that the Holy See at Tepeyac was left empty due to the sins of the papacy, many Vacandists attempted to elect their own popes in order to fill the vacancy. To accomplish this, wandering bishops would gather together to form their own conclaves. The bishops would then select one of their own to occupy the Holy See and take over the mantle of pope. These gatherings were typically rife with corruption, often being used by vacandist monarchs as a means of selecting compliant popes."
 actualizacion_vaca: "Actualización"
 desc_actualizacion_vaca: "One of the most pervasive elements of the Vacandist church was the push for progress known as “Actualización.” Vacandist scholars believed that the folly of the Catholic church was the suppression of heretical materials. By allowing these texts to be readily available and researched, the Vacandists believed that the populace would naturally come to reject them. This promoted an environment of scholarly investigation and debate in Vacandist academic communities."
 working_priesthood_vaca: "Working Priesthood"
 desc_working_priesthood_vaca: "Without the support of the large and wealthy Catholic church, many members of the former priesthood were forced to change their occupation. These Sacerdos Vagans, or wandering priests, would often found Vacandist brotherhoods in major cities and dedicate themselves to the production of trade goods."
 state_churches_vaca: "State Churches"
 desc_state_churches_vaca: "The onset of Vacandism in formerly Catholic states often led to trouble for rulers who shared deep ties with the church. In order to regain their influence in this respect, Vacandist nations would found unique churches that were closely tied into the interests of their government. These state churches would quickly dominate their respective nations due to their greater pool of resources and official recognition."
 preserving_the_sacraments: "Preserving The Sacraments"
 desc_preserving_the_sacraments: "Despite their differences in practice, most Vacandists share a belief in the legitimacy of the Catholic Sacraments. The acceptance of these seven rites is the most prominent connection that the Vacandist church shares with the old Tepeyac papacy."
 active_excommunication_vaca: "Active Excommunication"
 desc_active_excommunication_vaca: "As opposed to other Christian sects, Vacandists typically do not attempt to evangelize their particular flavor of belief. This tendency is built into the nature of the Vacandist faith, as most followers are still hopeful that the Tepeyac papacy will one day return to its rightful roots. However, there are some fringe Vacandist sects that believe that the Holy See has been entirely tainted. These zealots contend that because of this, performing the Sacraments as a member of the Catholic church amounts to heresy. Nations which followed this doctrine of “Active Excommunication” would often invest in the conversion of their populace and the abolition of traditional Catholic gatherings."
 la_dignidad_humana_vaca: "La Dignnidad Humana"
 desc_la_dignidad_humana_vaca: "Penned by the scholar Héctor Piñón, the pamphlet La Dignnidad Humana was a foundational piece of literature for the Vacandist faith. In its brief prose, Piñón demonstrates the necessity for a tolerant and secular state with historical examples. Years after its publication, as the first Vacandist rulers began to formalize their state churches, nations created “Dignidad Humana” laws which explicitly protected the rights of heretics and heathens within their nations."
 divinity_of_saints_vaca: "Divinity of Saints"
 desc_divinity_of_saints_vaca: "Saints, according to most Vacandists, are individuals who have been uniquely blessed and whose works are worthy of praise. While this is the same definition shared by Catholics, these two churches differ in their process of canonization. Since most Vacandist churches were controlled by the rulers of nations, sainthood often was used as a tool for encouragement and legitimacy. Dead rulers and fallen soldiers were routinely canonized in an attempt to preserve their legacies and inspire action."
 reviving_holy_spirits_vaca: "Reviving Holy Spirits"
 desc_reviving_holy_spirits_vaca: "Built into the Vacandist premise is a fundamental apathy. If the Tepeyac See is vacant, then there is nothing for the average follower to do. They cannot worship under a false church, nor can they adopt other beliefs lest they fall to heresy. The rise of conclavism and state churches eventually solved this issue as followers became invested in their faith once again with a renewed vigor."
 ecumenismo_vaca: "Ecumenismo"
 desc_ecumenismo_vaca: "After the fires of the Reformation began to die down, the Christians of Mexico were left in a difficult position. Deadlocked into religious alliances, any small conflict could balloon into a large-scale war. In order to prevent excessive bloodshed, nations and religious leaders would often diplomatically solve their issues at ecumenical councils. Vacandists routinely served as the middlemen in these situations, due to their neutrality and avoidance of evangelism."
 internal_confession_vaca: "Internal Confession"
 desc_internal_confession_vaca: "Though not typically supported by Vacandist churches, the practice of internal confession became increasingly popular amongst followers as the faith spread. When a nation would abandon their Catholic roots, there would often be a period of years during which churches would be left empty and without clergymen. The informal penance that emerged during this time continued to be practiced even once the Vacandist churches were established."
 wishful_thinking_vaca: "Wishful Thinking"
 desc_wishful_thinking_vaca: "Unlike most other reformation faiths, Vacandists did not tear down the Catholic institutions of their nation and rebuild. This is due to their belief that, one day, the Holy See will be filled again and they will return to the Catholic faith. In preparation for this day, Vacandist nations often attempt to preserve Catholic land and even invest in its development."
 vacandist_events.1.t: "Sundown Over Tepeyac"
 vacandist_events.1.d: "All good things must eventually come to an end. For centuries, the Catholic world has been guided by the papacy at Tepeyac. From that holy hill, the fate of empires and an untold amount of people were directed. Yet, this legitimacy and strength has begun to fade from its once bright heights. Successive popes have grown corrupt, lazy, and infirm. Such a sinful institution cannot stand for long. In light of this, many once pious Catholics have begun to seriously consider the notion of Sedevacantism. Believing the Holy See of Tepeyac to be vacant due to the sinful nature of its current occupier, these Vacandists have broken from the church. As the papacy's authority continues to degrade in the eyes of our people, whispers of this new heresy have spread throughout our court. Our administration is feeling the pressure of this new wave as religious leaders from throughout the Catholic world have begun to denounce the papacy and declare themselves Vacandists. In this new age of challenging ideas, this antiquated sinking ship might just bring us down with it. Perhaps it is finally time to break with the Catholic church and embrace something new."
 vacandist_events.1.a: "We will remain firm."
 vacandist_events.1.b: "The papacy has lost its way."
 vacandist_events.2.t: "Decline of The Faith"
 vacandist_events.2.d: "Despite our best efforts, the papacy’s status today is not what it once was. There was a time where even the most powerful of emperors would bend their knees to the supremacy of Tepeyac. Now, our church can hardly reign in our own bishops. It started with the Episcopus Vagans, wandering bishops. They strayed from the church’s light and preached their own heretical thoughts to a naive audience. The more they preached, the larger their audience grew. Then the heady intellectuals, those damned near heathens, poured gas on the fire. They branded themselves “Vacandists.” Took every part of the reformation that was attractive and fit it together without regard for logic or history. Treatise after treatise was written and distributed to every noble outside of Mexico City. There was nothing we could do to stop them even if we wanted to. Every curious prince, forgive them for they know not what they do, whispered what they had learned abroad into their father’s ears. That was the end. Those sinful tyrants learned of what they had to gain. Every halfway effective ruler now scrambles to found their own state church and denounce our Holy See. In a few years, there will be only a few that remain. All the blood, money, and history of the church: reduced to nothing. It's best not to wallow in it. We can only move forward. Perhaps one day, long after we have joined our Father, they will return."
 vacandist_events.2.a: "We will return!"
 vacandist_events.3.t: "Papal Nostolgia"
 vacandist_events.3.d: "The Vacandist faith has permanently separated our nation from the Tepeyac papacy. While this has freed us from the burden of the church’s lackluster authority, it has also brought on its own set of problems. For centuries, the Catholic church inhabited the hearts of our people. Their parents, grandparents, and great grandparents all followed the faith. This has entrenched the church into their history. While we have done a fine job of removing its influence from our state, the Tepeyac papacy still has its tendrils in the hearts of our people. Even now, as our nation prospers outside of his influence, many in our nation still hold the pope in a high regard. Our status as the nation’s religious authority gives us the chance to set an official position on this matter for our church."
 vacandist_events.3.a: "Better Times."
 vacandist_events.3.b: "No time to linger on the past."
 vacandist_events.4.t: "Bishop Questions"
 vacandist_events.4.d: "Vacandism was initially built by dissatisfied bishops. Known as Episcopus Vagans, or wandering bishops, these clergymen broke with Tepeyac and inspired citizens to do the same. Without their influence, it is doubtful that our nation would be in the position that it is today. Yet, in more recent times, the influence of these bishops has proven to be a liability. As we attempt to maintain our own national church, many bishops have come to criticize our decisions and denounce our administration. For this reason, some of our closest advisors have suggested that we nudge these dissenters out of their positions and replace them with our own loyal people."
 vacandist_events.4.a: "They will continue to provide guidance."
 vacandist_events.4.b: "We will take on the role."
 vacandist_events.4.c: "Our citizens can find their own faith."
 vacandist_events.5.t: "Fath Factionalism"
 vacandist_events.5.d: "One of the fundamental promises of Vacandism was personalism. A pope can hardly manage the needs of an entire nation, much less a continent. The bureaucratic and bloated church of old was doomed to collapse due to this reason. As Vacandists, we solved this issue by managing the church at a national level. This is what our citizens are supposed to believe, yet somehow they have gotten other notions in their heads. They now believe that they ought to be able to found their own churches and create their own Vacandist conclaves outside of our control. Of course, this is a completely heretical and terrible premise that must be shut down at once."
 vacandist_events.5.a: "Horror!"
 vacandist_events.6.t: "Sedevacantism"
 vacandist_events.6.d: "While many of our nation’s most educated and wealthy citizens have come to embrace the new faith of Vacandism, the same cannot be said for our general populace. This has not proved to be much of a problem, as our citizens have come to embrace the faith by themselves. Without our constant support, our citizens have come to view the Catholic church as the infirm institution it is. Across the countryside, they now adopt Sedevacantism in full."
 vacandist_events.6.a: "Wonderful!"
 vacandist_events.7.t: "The Pope's Fall"
 vacandist_events.7.d: "There has been a development among the Catholics of our nation. Apparently, they have shaken off the influence of the pope and now are moving in their own direction. In the province of [place_which_will_convert_to_vacandist.GetName], a group of so-called “Vacandists” have formed their own local conclave and rejected the occupier of the Holy See. We don’t care what they call themselves, they will come to embrace the true faith soon enough."
 vacandist_events.7.a: "Interesting."
