 HOLY_SITE_4128_DESC: "Panama, the southernmost City of Promise, was one of the most fervent Luzian centers. The commercial success of the city before its introduction to the faith led to an explosion of patronage upon its arrival. Luzite philosophers and artists were commissioned to create works which remained prominent for centuries. The success of the city and its association with the artistry of La Luz elevated Panama to a City of Promise."
 HOLY_SITE_4114_DESC: "Gran Chepe was the birthplace of Luzite thought. In the first cocoa houses founded in Isthmo, the smartest men of the day challenged the notions of the church and emerged with a startling realization. This realization has guided our faith and molded it to its current status. Gran Chepe was the first City of Promise and from its borders the Luzite faith spread to our ears."
 HOLY_SITE_4107_DESC: "The ancient city of Manague serves as a medium between the old and new. Centuries of history are contained in the city's walls, bringing with them the traditions and wisdom of the past. The status of La Luz in the city is much more muted, with most fervor contained to the churches. Despite this, the city remains a pious center of advancement for the faith."
 HOLY_SITE_2640_DESC: "Tegucigalpa was historically the largest Luzite center. When the faith first reached its walls, the city was firmly under the grip of Tepeyac. Luzians were required to gather in secret in order to follow their faith. Massacre after massacre of the pious have stained this city’s history with regret. Won through the blood of martyrs, Tegucigalpa earned its title as a City of Promise."
 HOLY_SITE_4089_DESC: "Ciudad de Guatemala, the northernmost City of Promise, represented the frontier of La Luz. The pious Luzians of the city were trapped under the thumb of the heretical Oaxacans. Through gradual resistance and civil negotiations, the Guatemalans were able to obtain their autonomy and join the other Cities of Promise in the light."

 la_luz_events.1.t: "A Bright Light"
 la_luz_events.1.d: "A troubling development has emerged from [place_that_la_luz_is_going_to_spawn.GetName]. They speak of a new heretical faith known as “La Luz.” Founded on the principles of Classical thought, these Luzites claim that their faith is perfectly rational. They claim that every man, woman, and child has a “light of promise” within them that will lead them towards salvation. Through investigation of the natural world and deep analysis, these Luzites believe themselves to have found the very essence of God. To our ears, it all sounds like heresy. In their stuffy and selfagrandizing cocoa houses, those eggheads came up with a system too clever for its own good. This supposed “light” sounds nothing like the word of the lord, rather the work of devils! This horrible worship threatens to tear apart our very faith. In the province of [place_that_la_luz_is_going_to_spawn.GetName], these Luzians have begun to fervently preach their heretical ways. From house to house, they will corrupt our nation until all is tainted in their wicked sin. We must act, rout out these terrible foes, and secure the unity of our nation before it is too late. May the Lord protect us in this endeavor and secure the expulsion of evil from the fair [place_that_la_luz_is_going_to_spawn.GetName]."
 la_luz_events.1.a: "Heresy!"
 la_luz_events.2.t: "Extremists in Isthmo"
 la_luz_events.2.d: "Terrible news has reached [Root.Capital.GetName] from our holy advisors in Isthmo. According to them,  a new heretical faith is quickly spreading throughout the region and threatens to lead many astray. The heretics call themselves “Luzites” and claim to have reasoned their way into the proper practice of Christianity. Coming from the minds of Isthmo philosophers and academics, their well reasoned treatises are complicated enough to boggle even the most learned minds. They have denounced our office of the papacy as a “corrupt and unnecessary institution.” Their endless fervor has already damaged our reputation through their incessant desire to besmirch our authority. We must reach out to all of the pious lords of Isthmo and work with them to snuff out this heretical branch. With our hands full with the Cruzites in the north, we must work carefully to ensure that Catholicism stays whole for future believers."
 la_luz_events.2.a: "Horror!"
 la_luz_events.3.t: "City of Promise"
 la_luz_events.3.d: "The Luzian faith initially emerged from five “Cities of Promise.” Each of the cities were prominent in their region and reflected a fundamental evolution of the faith. For example, the city of Chepe was the birthplace of Luzian thought and subsequently the first City of Promise. From these cities, the Luzian world was managed and the faith expanded. Our nation currently holds one of these cities and, for better or worse, must accept the consequences of ownership. In the city streets, pious Luzites cry for progress and rationalism. In the cocoa houses they obsess over every detail of their treaties. They yearn for more. They yearn that we may join them in worship."
 la_luz_events.3.a: "Interesting."
 la_luz_events.4.t: "Catholic Backlash"
 la_luz_events.4.d: "While many in our nation have come to embrace La Luz, some are still bitterly resisting our attempts at conversion. In the province of [uncooperative_catholics_laluz.GetName], a gaggle of papists are going above and beyond to resist our rule. Any Luzite official or missionary sent to the province has been rejected. Essentially shunned by the entire community, these Catholics have irrevocably damaged our ability to rule over the province. The only way for our administration to retain control of the province would be to get involved directly, however this would likely lead to an outright revolt. We must be careful to manage the risks of this situation lest it develops into something we cannot handle."
 la_luz_events.4.a: "It is their right."
 la_luz_events.4.b: "They will pay!"
 la_luz_events.5.t: "Cocoa Houses"
 la_luz_events.5.d: "Cocoa was a popular and expensive drink throughout the Catholic world. Due to the finicky nature of cocoa production, many would gather in large common buildings to be served cocoa by special tappers. These cocoa houses came to be a place for the discussion of new ideas, philosophies, and discoveries. In Isthmo particularly, cocoa houses came to symbolize the affluent and educated post-republic elite of the region. With all this in mind it should be no surprise that the first members of La Luz emerged from these unique environments. Even now, as we have embraced the faith in earnest, these cocoa houses still serve as a place for contemplation and investigation. In the city of [cocoa_houses_holy_city_prov_laluz.GetName] a newly opened cocoa house has drawn the attention of the city’s most talented individuals. Such gifted individuals all under one roof, something magical is bound to happen."

 la_luz_events.5.c: "On the Cutting Edge!"
 la_luz_events.6.t: "An Isthmo Faith"
 la_luz_events.6.d: "Founded in Isthmo, spread in Isthmo, La Luz will likely have its final follower in Isthmo. Some have referred to it as an ethnic religion, but Luzians will be quick to point out that this is not necessarily the case. Rather, it is the history and culture of the Luzian people that has molded them to perfectly be accepting of the truth of the world. Others in our nation, that are not of the Isthmo persuasion, have begun to feel excluded from our faith despite their conviction. We must carefully decide how to proceed, making sure not to totally compromise the integrity of our faith for those who feel left behind."
 la_luz_events.6.a: "Regretable"
 la_luz_events.6.b: "We can Alter the Faith"

 la_luz_events.7.t: "Wordly Pursuits"
 la_luz_events.7.d: "Just as all of our subjects are expected to find their own light through investigation and reflection, we too are called as rulers to investigate and understand ourselves. Luzite rulers typically pursue some personal goal alongside their ambitions for their nation. Whether it be to discover something new about the faith, understand the natural world, or investigate some matter of science, these pursuits edify a ruler and ensure that they can best serve their people. It has come time for us to choose a path which will best reflect the interests of our administration."
 la_luz_events.7.a: "We will improve our administration"
 la_luz_events.7.b: "We will work on our health"
 la_luz_events.7.c: "We will build up the cities"
 la_luz_events.7.e: "We will reach out to others"
 la_luz_events.8.t: "A Rational Faith"
 la_luz_events.8.d: "Progression and rationalism lie at the heart of our faith. The cocoa houses of Luzian society have always existed on the cutting edge. New philosophies and discoveries float alongside the chocolate scent. Despite this, our nation seems to have fallen behind. Our lack of certain fundamental institutions has placed us behind our peers in terms of advancement and enlightenment. This worrying development has become the talk of cocoa houses in [Root.Capital.GetName] as many local leaders attempt to advance the city."
 la_luz_events.8.a: "Interesting"
 la_luz_events.9.t: "New World Rationalism"
 la_luz_events.9.d: "Across the waves, the continent of Akilineq and Pablonia were primed for enlightenment thought. The unruly and heretical members of Catholic society were often exiled abroad in order to better the stock back home. However, when moved to the frontier, far away from the prying eyes of Tepeyac, these heretics were able to explore their faith in earnest. As a Catholic colony, we now experience pain from the sins of our colonial parents as the heretical Luzites accost our borders. They flood in like vermin, spreading their wicked sermons to all who are willing to listen. We must do something to ensure that they are dealt with, before it is too late."
