 neoshinto_events.1.t: "Footsteps of the Reiwas"
 neoshinto_events.1.d: "The ancient Reiwa dynasty may be nothing more than a name and a few legends, but its influence can be felt throughout these fair isles. For centuries, the Reiwas controlled Japan and introduced many to the true faith of Shinto. Under their banner the different tribal lords of early Japan were brought to kneel and enlightened. Ever since, none have managed to achieve their sublime heights. Those that endeavor to follow in their footsteps often devote themselves to the Reiwa family deity: Amaterasu. Our rule has become tied with this very deity and, by extension, draws its legitimacy from the sun kami. While this status has benefited our rule, sometimes it is necessary to reflect on the nature of this relationship. Are we truly the heirs of this ancient legacy, or perhaps something new?"

 neoshinto_events.2.t: "Sunshine"
 neoshinto_events.2.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has spent a large portion of the past ten years reflecting on the true nature of their rule and legacy. Ever since the start of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reign, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has been defined by the legacy of the Reiwa. While this legacy was certainly something which greatly increased [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s legitimacy, it was not something earned. Instead, the association was simply given for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] choice of kami. This troubling realization led to a crisis of identity for [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Every night for a year, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would watch the city streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] and try to make sense of why the common people could not see [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fraud. How they could just ignore the fact that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had done nothing for them beyond speak empty words and wave. The questions begun to overwhelm [Root.Monarch.GetName] until, in a feverish state, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] disguised [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in common clothes and approached a merchant in the city below. [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked him why he continued to be a servant of such a fraudlent [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The merchant, exhausted from a day of work, simply pointed to the large walls that surrounded the city and mumbled “A [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] built those walls, and as long as someone keeps them up, I can live easy.” Over the next week, [Root.Monarch.GetName] recounted this response again and again, trying to make sense of the merchant’s words. Finally, just as the sun reached its height for the day, [Root.Monarch.GetName] understood all at once. It was [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arrogance and lust for showy accomplishments that made [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] forget [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] most basic responsibility: to rule. A [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s responsibility is to care for their people and give them fulfilling lives, not to leave behind some grand legacy. Staring down at the sunny streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] below, [Root.Monarch.GetName] smiled and began to plan what was to come next."

 neoshinto_events.3.d: "Our embrace of Amaterasu as the patron kami of our rule has granted us extraordinary benefits. Whether this be routinely sunny skies or prophetic visions in dreams, Amaterasu has made sure our reign is filled with grace and success. These same blessings have managed to even extend to some of our own citizens, as their own lives improve through Amaterasu’s grace. News has reached [Root.Capital.GetName] of a rising star among our own military. Supposedly, a new recruit shows talent unparalleled by some of our most successful generals. Some in the hinterlands have begun to call this individual the “Sun Knight” for their bold demeanor and superb abilities. Depending on how we decide to use this asset, we could either gain assistance in our military affairs or a new general to directly command the forces."

 neoshinto_events.4.t: "Cult of the Sun"
 neoshinto_events.4.d: "While we are certainly loyal to the patron deity of our administration, Amaterasu, there are some who take their devotion too far. Among these are the fanatical “Sun Cultists” who reject the authority of any other kami besides Amaterasu. In their minds, it is only with the help of the sun that we are able to live in a world of light. This line of thinking leads most Sun Cultists to reject other kami as simple “spirits” and wholeheartedly devote themselves to the sole worship of Amaterasu. Some of the most influential members of the cult have assembled in our capital to try and garner support from members of our administration. This has, as it always tends to do, put pressure on our ruler to take a specific stance. A strong statement on either side of the issue could paint our administration differently to members of the populace and outside world."

 neoshinto_events.5.t: "Luck Across the Waves"
 neoshinto_events.5.d: "Taming the new world across the waves has not come easy. Many have given up cushy lives to travel far away and expand our territory. Luckily, our administration’s patron deity has endeavored to make the process more painless through providing willing settlers. In a stroke of nearly divine luck, a group of refugees recently arrived in our borders who claimed to be originally from [Root.Capital.GetName]. Nearly six hundred among them wished to travel with our colonists to the frontier and establish a brand new life across the waves. With their numbers, our current colonies will be pushed much further along into becoming productive parts of our realm."

 neoshinto_events.6.t: "The Balance of Luck"
 neoshinto_events.6.d: "The palace of [Root.Capital.GetName] was being remodeled to fit our administration’s focus on the patron deity Ebisu when the laymen found something remarkable. A great stone door was built into the foundation, which in turn led to an ancient tomb of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty. In a room fortified deep within the ruins, the workers found a large chest emblazoned with the family crest. Before going any further, word was sent to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for permission to investigate. Curious of the mysterious chest, [Root.Monarch.GetName] traveled to the site personally in order to see what lay within. After chiseling away at the ancient lock, the crew lifted the heavy lid of the chest and looked within to find…"

 neoshinto_events.7.t: "Meditative Balance"
 neoshinto_events.7.d: "Deep within the tomb of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty, tucked into a fortified room, a large chest laid undiscovered for centuries. When [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally had the box opened, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] found nothing but dust and ashes within. This was, of course, shocking to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as they had expected the patron kami Ebisu to use the chest as an opportunity to grant [Root.Monarch.GetName] many riches. Throughout [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reign, Ebisu had used luck to improve the lives of the [Root.GetName] people. However, when an obvious opportunity presented itself for Ebisu to take advantage of, it seemed to intentionally do nothing. For many years, this incident stuck with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] worked tirelessly to provide for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people. Had Ebisu simply overlooked this circumstance or perhaps there was some deeper meaning to the gesture. Even after consulting with some of the foremost experts on religious matters in the nation, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was unable to find any answer which felt complete. One day, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to retreat into solitude until the answer could be found. After months of pain and thirst no solution presented itself. Defeated, [Root.Monarch.GetName] traveled to the public gardens of [Root.Capital.GetName] in order to feast on some of the fresh fruit. It was while reaching to a low hanging pear that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] finally realized why Ebisu had neglected to fill the chest so long ago. It was through working with Ebisu that the people of [Root.GetName] had their lives improved, not purely through the luck of the kami. The chest was of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty, meaning that it was up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to fill. It was with this new outlook, that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] went forward to enrich his people, with the assistance of luck behind [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."

 neoshinto_events.8.t: "Fish of [fish_prov_for_shin_loc.GetName]"
 neoshinto_events.8.d: "The patron kami of our rule, Ebisu, is heavily associated with fishermen. For centuries, the wranglers of our nation have given themselves to Ebisu in order to improve their catch. Ever since we decided to take on the kami as a representative of our rule, our fishermen have vastly increased the volume of their catch. Nowhere has this become more apparent than in the city of [fish_prov_for_shin_loc.GetName]. Ever since the start of our reign, the waters around the city have been filled with delectable fish of all types. For this reason, [fish_prov_for_shin_loc.GetName] has seen expansion as many wannabe wranglers travel to the city in order to make themselves rich. This increased wealth has led to more taxes for our administration which we could either further invest into [fish_prov_for_shin_loc.GetName] or keep for ourselves."

 neoshinto_events.9.d: "During such tumultuous times of war, it is important that our administration retains some level of order. Through choosing Raijin as the patron kami of our administration, we can learn from the calamity and calm of storms. Our soldiers are in dire need of some calming influence as their livelihood and faith are challenged in this conflict. Let us take a moment and draft up a speech to inspire the soldiers to continue their fight in a way that will provide us with the most success. Through either asking them to push forward or hold rank, we can hopefully bolster our forces and ensure victory. Of course, asking them to risk their lives in this conflict can only be done sincerely if we are convinced of our purpose. Perhaps it would be better for our nation’s future success if we reflected on the exact nature of why we chose to wage war."

 neoshinto_events.10.t: "Why Do We Fight?"
 neoshinto_events.10.d: "For centuries, nations have waged war for many reasons which seem silly to us now. The ancient Reiwas originally started their conquest of Florida in order to punish the Disney tribe for a simple mistake of their patriarch. Instead of bowing before the Reiwa emperor, the patriarch kneeled. With a modern perspective, we can point out the ridiculous flaws in such a notion, but what stops someone further into the future from criticizing our casus belli? It was this line of reasoning which came to trouble [Root.Monarch.GetName]. For nearly seven years, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] pondered the issue. Eventually, when introspection seemed to lead to nothing but confusion, [Root.Monarch.GetName] started asking other rulers and high ranking officials how they justified this apparent incongruity. More often than not, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] concerns were waived away as being the doubts of an inexperienced [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. However, during one diplomatic meeting, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was met face to face with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] great rival [rival_of_our_guy.Monarch.GetName]. Attempting to avoid an ugly confrontation, [Root.Monarch.GetName] moved towards the door, but was stopped by the loud boom of thunder. There was no telling how long the outside storm would last, and in order to appear cordial, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] allowed [rival_of_our_guy.Monarch.GetName] to stay within the palace. It was after two hours of being stuck in this awkward situation that [Root.Monarch.GetName] realized what was happening. Raijin, the kami of storms and patron of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule, had finally answered that long nagging question. Just as the storm had stuck [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [rival_of_our_guy.Monarch.GetName] together, the wars fought by the [Root.GetName] were simply circumstances created by forces uncontrollable by man. The reasons for conflict did not matter, in the grand scheme of it all, because they were not the driving force. Instead the kami and the nature they wielded led to bloodshed and violence. With this in mind, [Root.Monarch.GetName] reasoned that wars should be fought in a way which glorifies the combatants. Looking towards [rival_of_our_guy.Monarch.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetName] smiled, finally sure of what should be done."

 neoshinto_events.11.t: "Storms of Life"
 neoshinto_events.11.d: "Raijin, the kami of storms and patron deity of our rule, is associated with storms, thunder, and lightning. These forces of nature contribute to a more chaotic temperament in the kami which makes it a more maligned deity. However, many throughout our nation still pledge themselves to this capricious kami for the aftermath of storms. The storms, which may cause ruin, leave behind valuable water that nurtures crops and sates the thirst of livestock. In the city of [grain_province_with_storms.GetName], a great storm left behind a glut of rain which seemed to produce a more bountiful harvest. With these new crops, the next generation of [grain_province_with_storms.GetName] will grow strong and ready to serve their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

Rising through the ranks of local government, the soldier gained notoriety for his absolute loyalty and cunning. Many have begun to see the extraordinary circumstances of his birth and subsequent actions as a sign of divine intervention. The patron kami of our rule, Raijin, might have used its mastery over the storms to imbue a child with divine legitimacy. If this is true, the warrior of [Root.Capital.GetName] should serve a more important role in our administration. Some of our advisors have suggested that we invite him to join our innermost cabinet, while others have even floated the idea of the warrior taking over as heir to the throne. Whatever our choice, let us make sure Raijin’s gift does not go to waste."

In [Root.Capital.GetName], the city streets are littered with new inventions and pamphlets depicting modern progress. Just as Tenjin pushed forward the boundaries of his own time, we too shall buck against the limitations of our modern day and advance forward. While the other nations of the world are beginning to lag behind, let us seize this opportunity and set ourselves apart."

Through our adoption of Tenjin, the kami of innovation and scholarship, as the patron deity of our rule, we have decided to reflect the values of progress and advancement to our people. Throughout our nation, academics are revered and their work appreciated due to our actions. [Root.Monarch.GetName] prides [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] as a so-called Scholar [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. However, this status has been challenged as academics call upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] to investigate the natural world. While we can simply ignore their cries, some of our advisors have suggested that we retreat into study for a period in order to bolster our image. Beyond simple politics, perhaps a period of study will work to edify [Root.Monarch.GetName] and ensure that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is the right [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] for [Root.GetName]."

 neoshinto_events.15.d: "Retreating into study, [Root.Monarch.GetName] worked feverishly to discover the secrets of the natural world. For the first years, [Root.Monarch.GetName] barely communicated with the outside world, only leaving the palace in order to meet with diplomatic consultations and lead battles. Yet, despite all of the studying, [Root.Monarch.GetName] got no closer to any concrete answers. It wouldn’t be until [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] traveled to meet with other scholars that progress would begin. Communicating with like minded scholars, [Root.Monarch.GetName] became surrounded with competing viewpoints on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] work. With these conflicting opinions came doubt as [Root.Monarch.GetName] began to question if there were any concrete answers to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] study. Despite all of these nagging doubts, [Root.Monarch.GetName] pushed forward with faith that there was something at the end of this line of reason. However, nearly six years into study, everything fell apart. With no clear answers and progress slowing by the day, [Root.Monarch.GetName] gave up. It was obvious that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was no scholar [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], much less an academic. Yet, despite all odds, it finally clicked. Extrapolating [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] research onto another topic and consulting with some more experts, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was able to make a new discovery. After ten long years of study, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had finally proved those stuck up academics wrong."

 neoshinto_events.16.t: "Futuristic Investment"
 neoshinto_events.16.d: "Progress doesn't come cheap. Investigating the natural world requires expensive equipment and elaboration experiments. With our commitment to honor Tenjin as the patron kami of our rule, we have encouraged many in our nation to take up academic causes. While this is certainly beneficial for the progress of our nation, it also brings some hefty costs. Some of these academics have begun to petition our administration for funds for their research. Investing in this cause will likely cost our nation temporarily, but will pay dividends in the wealth of future research. While some of our advisors have cautioned against emptying our treasury for such a cause, it is our duty as the Scholar [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to encourage progress. Let us consider this decision carefully, for the sake of the academics and our wallet."

Across the countryside, the antiquated practices of farmers have been made more efficient than ever. Thousands of our citizens now flock to the cities to find work in the new factories. Despite this glut of change, there remains continuity with our ancient beliefs and practices. The patron kami of our rule, Inari Okami, has become emblematic of this new industrialization for its values of productivity and prosperity. It is through the will of this kami that the skies are littered with smoke and the cities stretch into the heavens. Let us take a moment to give thanks and embrace the new changes which modernity has brought us while remembering the old ways."

With it by our side, we have worked hard to ensure that our nation perfects itself in production to ensure prosperity. In the city of [a_province_for_perfecting_shin.GetName], we have begun our efforts by compelling the religiously zealous to construct improvements. Using their own labor and funds, these devout followers have constructed houses, provided for the poor, and assisted craftsmen in their production. Our advisors have theorized that a nationwide campaign in this same vein would greatly improve the lives of our citizens and lead to greater prosperity.

Working with our cabinet of advisors and [Root.Monarch.GetName], these lords would report their progress and draft more citizens as needed. Just as was done originally, these faithful citizens helped to improve aspects of their assigned city and countryside. Building houses, digging new wells, and assisting local craftsmen were all done in order to ensure prosperity among the people of [Root.GetName]. Through all of the hard work, not a single cent was spent by our administration. It truly is a marvel, what work can be done when united under the faith.

It is this last topic that is of special relevance to our current circumstances, as a smith in our nation has recently forged a blade of special significance. The special blend of metals and guiding hand of Inari has led the weapon to be nearly indestructible. Traveling to [Root.Capital.GetName], the blacksmith who forged the blade arrived at the imperial palace to present it to our monarch. We must decide now what to do with the weapon. Keeping it for ourselves would be a waste, so some have suggested that we use it as an inspiration to the soldiers. Our more military minded advisors have suggested that it serve its intended purpose and be used on the battlefield. Others have suggested that we place it in the hands of a talented general as a tool for leading the soldiers. Whatever our choice, let us make sure that this craftsmanship does not go to waste."

 neoshinto_events.24.d: "In Tokyo, the historic home of the shogun, a shrine to the kami of scholarship stands as a monument to progress. Throughout the history of these fair isles, many influential rulers have visited the shrine in order to bask in the wisdom of their ancestors. However, with the advent of our reign, the shrine has begun to degrade as more visitors venture to the site. With a portion of our administration’s funds we could potentially restore the shrine and expand it to harbor more people. Alternatively, we could just as easily use our ownership of the shrine as a means to bolster the values of our administration and embolden our rule."

 neoshinto_events.25.d: "In the city of Kyoto, a shrine to Inari Okami stands tall as one of the most important sites in all of Shinto. Due to the eclectic nature of Inari Okami’s influences, the deity is routinely venerated throughout the isles by all manner of professions and peoples. As the central shrine of the deity, Fishimi Inari-Taisha stands tall as an important gathering point for the faithful among our nation. However, once we committed ourselves to the kami, the shrine experienced an influx of visitors who have worn down its structure. We could invest a portion of our administration’s resources to restore the shrine to ensure that future generations can enjoy its history. However, we could just as easily use our ownership of the shrine as a means to bolster the values of our administration and embolden our rule."

 neoshinto_events.26.d: "Shrines are important parts of Shinto society. Kami are enshrined in these holy structures which doubly serve as places of introspection for the faithful. Networks of different shrines litter the countryside of our realm, each of which requires an incredible amount of maintenance. For this reason, some in our nation have risen up and dedicated their lives to caring for the shrines. Among them are the influential Shake families who have requested that we maintain their dominance of the shrines through an official decree. Handing out contracts for ownership and maintenance of the shrines to their family line will have them become a permanent fixture of their respective province, which in the long run might lead to problems. A class of wealthy and religiously authoritative citizens could threaten our rule. On the other hand, if we keep their influence in check and ensure that they stay productive, the Shake could help us to convert wayward heathens and develop the land. Testing the waters by providing just one shrine to the Shake in [test_province_for_shake.GetName] could give insight into their true intentions. Let us consider the possible ramifications of our decision here and act in the best interest of our administration and the divine."

 neoshinto_events.27.d: "The shrine in [province_that_shakes_are_demanding.GetName] has posed some problems for the local administration. Few in the province visit the shrine, yet it attracts visitors from afar frequently. For this reason, there has been little public will to maintain the shrine and even less of a desire to have someone permanently placed in charge of the it. Over the past few months, the shrine has degraded to a point of disrepair. In a gesture of firm kindness, the Shake of our nation have demanded that someone be given a contract for this shrine in order to ensure that it is cared for. If we were to relinquish control of the shrine, it would no doubt quickly be improved to a tenable state, but we would give the Shake further influence."

 neoshinto_events.28.t: "Shake Influence Government"
 neoshinto_events.28.d: "Ever since they first rose to power, the Shake have desperately been attempting to claim power over our nation. Through using their influence to amass great fortunes, the Shake have grown rich beyond imagination. With their wealth, they have corrupted officials at all levels of government and used this influence to ensure that they remain in power. Now that their tendrils have wormed their way into every official’s pocket, the Shake have started to influence our innermost circle. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s most trusted advisors now spread the messages of the Shake into the highest levels of government. Some in our administration have managed to resist this temptation and have suggested that we strike back by revoking one of the Shake’s contracts."

 neoshinto_events.29.d: "The Shake have grown to be a very influential part of our nation as they amass wealth and power from their shrines. This is something that our administration greatly fears, with good reason, but sometimes it has its perks. Our current conflict pits us against a common enemy, which has led the Shake to support our aims directly. With the help of such an influential group, our nation is relieved and beginning to rally around the promise of victory. Distributing supplies from shrines and tapping into their vast wealth, the Shake will prove an instrumental part of our future plans. Let us work together, for just this moment, to win over these foreign enemies."

 neoshinto_events.30.d: "Through corrupting officials at all levels of government and years of planning, the Shake have managed to generate outrage at our rule. Citizens from across the country are raising arms against our administration and demanding that we retire from our post. Of course, they have been deceived into believing that our replacement should be one among the influential Shake. With such entrenched Shake influence, many in our administration have also been deceived into believing that we should resign. Even if we were to defeat these revolutionaries, it is doubtful that we could ever fully remove the taint of Shake influence from our own government. Perhaps it would be for the best if we simply stepped down and let the Shake take over. Let us carefully consider this difficult choice and make a decision which will best serve our nation."

 neoshinto_events.31.t: "The Danka System"
 neoshinto_events.31.d: "Long ago, much of the land was dominated by Zenist influence. This pre-Reiwa faith featured only a handful of the traditional shinto elements. Despite its decline, small clues of its influence still linger among some of our traditions. A handful of shrines in our nation feature a close relationship with their respective communities. As part of this relationship, the citizens pay a portion of their wealth into the shrine and, in turn, the priests of the shrine provide spiritual guidance for the citizens. This close relationship was known as the Danka system and was required for Zenist communities. Centuries ago, the Reiwa dynasty forbade the establishment of such a relationship, seeing the practice as heretical. Some among our administration have suggested that we bring back the system as a means to fund local shrines and keep tabs on our citizens. Using the shrine wardens as the eyes of our state, we could potentially stop any insurgencies before they begin."

 neoshinto_events.32.d: "In the tumultuous times that we live in, even our very faith is challenged by the surrounding world. In order to combat the new waves of heretical thought and religious nihilism, some members of the public have begun to shy away from visiting public shrines. Instead, many have begun to construct small shrines to individual kamis within their own homes. This more personal form of worship has led to a deeper faith among some and heretical practices among others. Without the gentle guidance of religious authorities, how can these commonfolk be trusted to practice the right form of the faith? This very question has haunted our administration as we seek to find a solution to this issue. If we continue to let the commoners hold worship within their homes, we risk declining the influence of real shrines and contributing to a fractured faith. On the other hand, it is almost impossible to police home shrines. A nationwide campaign of destroying home shrines would reflect on us terribly, but would no doubt consolidate our faith into a single cohesive practice. Hopefully, whatever choice we pick, will usher in the return of simpler and more peaceful times."

 neoshinto_events.33.t: "Decline of Shrine Influence"
 neoshinto_events.33.d: "Our decision to allow shrines within the home has, as predicted, led to a decline of the influence of public shrines. Across the nation, public shrines are starting to stagnate and even shut down as fewer and fewer citizens see a purpose in visiting them. For centuries, these ancient shrines have served as a place for gathering and introspection, yet now they fall into disrepair. Locked up into their own homes and obsessed with their own idols, our nation is fractured in their belief. The continuity of one faith is lost, let us hope that one day it will return."
 neoshinto_events.33.a: "Sad"
 neoshinto_events.34.t: "Shrine Communities"
 neoshinto_events.34.d: "Miraculously the public shrines of our nation have made a return as many take interest in their ancient majesty. As the number of home shrines grew, a deeper appreciation for the faith was achieved by many throughout our nation. This greater devotion in turn created a demand for a more personal involvement with the faith as zealous followers flocked to these ancient shrines for contemplation and worship. The communities that surround these ancient shrines have begun to define themselves by the ancient history of their local kami and its respective influences. While our nation is not united under one practice of Shinto, it is now whole in its appreciation for the world. Let us take a moment and rejoice, for our navigation of this crisis and victory over the pressure of modernity."
 neoshinto_events.34.a: "Our nation is whole once again"
 neoshinto_events.35.t: "Fall of Shake Influence"
 neoshinto_events.35.d: "A pleasant consequence of the decline of shrine influence has been the fall of Shake power. Throughout their time in power, the Shake attempted to amass wealth and challenge our rule. Now that many citizens rely on shrines within their homes for their religious guidance, the Shake have far less influence over their local communities. No longer will the Shake hang over us and threaten everything we have built, we are free from their infernal schemes. Hopefully, no matter what changes with the status quo, this shift in power will remain."

 neoshinto_events.36.d: "From far away, a group of travelers has arrived in our land who brand themselves as “Theanites.” Though we have not heard of them, they seem to have a great knowledge of obscure parts of our own religion. From consulting with our scholars, apparently these travelers are of Sacramental ilk. After getting a personal audience with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the travelers requested that we “teach them our ways.” Our advisors have no idea what this means, with some interpreting it as some sort of threat or will for conversion. Seeing as they will not leave until we give them a response, we must make a decision as to whether or not we will indulge their request. On one hand, opening talks with heathens could go far in helping interfaith relations for our nation. Alternatively, we could make a strong statement against heathen practice by rejecting their advance. Let us use their arrival as a platform to make a statement on the status of other religions under our reign."

Our own merchants frequently travel the waters in order to sell their illustrious goods to the Antebellan rubes. However, some have come to question whether profiting off of the heathens is within the natural order. Some in our administration have begun to call for ending trade with [evan_echange_partner_shin.GetName] in order to further insulate our nation. Covertly decreasing trade between our two nations will undoubtedly cause a decrease in profits for the both of us, but is unlikely to impact relations. On the other hand, we could further encourage trade between our nations and achieve mutual benefits."

Some of the goods traded across those waves have embedded themselves into Dixie culture, like the Japanese teas.

Upon this wood, the visitor will write a wish which they will leave with the kami. While [Root.Monarch.GetName] typically stays away from such superstitious beliefs, during a recent visit to the shrine in [Root.Capital.GetName] something compelled [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to leave behind a wish. What followed this urge was a moment of contemplation, what exactly would [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wish for? As the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of a great nation, there was little which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could ever need that wasn’t provided for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].

However, after wishing for prosperity at the shrine of [Root.Capital.GetName], the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was shocked to find [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nation overcome with prosperity. All around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], farmers experienced bountiful harvests and fishermen had full nets. Soldiers fought with an unexpected strength and academics discovered the mysteries of the natural world left and right. Even the very fabric of government seemed to run faster after the wish.

In the halls of the palace, all advisors looked to [Root.Monarch.GetName] with utter reverence. When passing through the city streets of [Root.Capital.GetName], every citizen bowed before [Root.Monarch.GetName]. When visiting foreign rulers, most gave into [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s demands.

This mindset was affirmed, when [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wish left at the shrine of [Root.Capital.GetName] was unfulfilled.

However, some among our populace have begun to express concerns surrounding the purity of our own administration. They claim that certain officials in the palace are unclean and corrupted by outside influence. Whether this is true or not, the perception of its truth could provide our administration with a negative public perception. To remedy this, some of our advisors have suggested that we enlist the help of priests from our shrine in [Root.Capital.GetName]. While this would certainly slow down our current progress, it may be necessary in order to ensure our future success."

Ever since this time, Aomori has become synonymous with the Itako's wisdom and the place where most of them gather. Occasionally, these Itako will make a similar journey across the isle of Honshu in order to aid locals and commune with the kami. Now, our ownership of Aomori grants us an exclusive look at this ancient rite as the Itako begin their journey south.

An ancient folk kami which was banned during the Riewa era has reemerged as a popular figure for veneration. Kirisuto featured prominently in a number of different faiths before the Reiwa era. For Zenists he was a Buddha, while for the Kurisuchan Kirisuto was the founder of their faith. The foreign missionaries in our realm used this ancient figure as a means to attempt conversion of our populace. While this was undoubtedly somewhat successful, it has mostly whipped our population into a Kirisuto fervor. Whatever the ultimate result of this fervor, we now have another popular kami which our progeny may use as the patron of their reign."

With the influence flowing in from their worship, some of our own citizens have begun to pick up the practice. The strangest part of this all, is that the kami in question hasn’t been relevant in Japanese society for centuries. Kirisuto, kami of Tolerance, was an ancient folk spirit which was shared across multiple Japanese religions before the Riewa consolidated Shinto. For Zenists he was a Buddha, while for the Kurisuchan Kirisuto was the founder of their faith. Now, for our administration, he is a kami which could serve as the patron deity of our dynasty one day.

This book had been hand delivered by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ally from [chris_state_to_conv_shin.GetName], [chris_state_to_conv_shin.Monarch.GetName]. Just last week, they had debated over the identity of [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] court and whether or not it truly fell into the wide bubble of Christianity. Of course they both believed in Kirisuto, but to what extent were they the same person. The Kirisuto of the [chris_state_to_conv_shin.Religion.GetName]s seemed to have more volume than the old tales of the kami. Indeed, maybe Kirisuto was just a blended figure, one who only emerged as a meeting between Christianity and Shinto. However, this troubled [Root.Monarch.GetName], as Kirisuto had existed in the isles during a time long before the arrival of the Sacramentals or even the Evangelicals. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was then faced with the most difficult question: where was the reverse? Among the Sacramentals, Evangelicals, and Catholics, which had kami that had blended into their religion. To [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] recollection, there was none, meaning that Kirisuto must be a figure that predates all of them. Realizing this, [Root.Monarch.GetName] began to panic. If Kirisuto predated the kami, then were they truly practicing the true faith? To finally put the issue to rest, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] decided to go forward and…"

 neoshinto_events.59.d: "Our adoption of Kirisuto as the patron kami of our administration has brought with it some triumphs and difficulties, but we are now in a position to gain much. Some in our court have decided to travel the seedier path through life, taking on bribes and making backroom deals. With our commitment to purity, none in our court will be able to continue this life. From this day forward, we will root out this corruption and create a culture of dedication among all servants. Let us put our best foot forward and announce this to the people of our administration, they will come to appreciate our commitment in time."

 neoshinto_events.60.t: "Daitenku Taro Jurai"
 neoshinto_events.60.d: "Far in the north, in the province of Aomori, the shrine of Daitenku Taro Jurai has remained committed to preserving the kami of Kirisuto since ancient times. Throughout the centuries, this shrine has seen few visitors as Kirisuto faded into irrelevance. However, with our administration’s use of the kami as the patron deity of our rule, the shrine has once again risen to prominence and become a place for the faithful to gather. Sadly, the shrine was not prepared for the influx of visitors and has started to show obvious signs of wear. In order to preserve it for future generations, we could invest some of our administration’s resources into the shrine’s restoration. However, we could just as easily use our ownership of the shrine as a means to bolster the values of our administration and embolden our rule."
