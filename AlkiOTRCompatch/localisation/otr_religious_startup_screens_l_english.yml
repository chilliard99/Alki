They will bring with them strife and new parties.\n\n§MLore§!\n\nPartisans believe in the existence of one universal §YFounder§!. This great deity is said to have ordered the world and created the foundation for the Union of California. This story, among many others, is laid out in the §YConstitution§!. The amendments in this holy book are piously observed by Partisans, but also fiercely debated to their exact meaning. The Constitution itself is a mangled version of the ancient §YUnited States Constitution§!.\n\nThe Founder eventually left the world under the care of §YThe Spirit of Liberty§!, sometimes referred to as The Great Spirit. This ethereal being is said to guide the actions of individuals and carry out The Founder’s will. Populists believe that The Spirit of Liberty exists in all people, while Regalists believe that The Spirits of Liberty only guides those in power. Depending on an individual’s interpretation on the Constitution and other matters of the faith, they will typically align themselves with a particular party. These parties serve both a religious and political purpose, dictating the course of Union elections and daily worship.\n\nDue to centuries of interchange and subjugation by Sacramentals, Partisianity has come to adopt many aspects of Ogdonianism. Most prominent among these is their embrace of the Ogdonian bible, the rules of which have come to be seen as equal to amendments."

Centuries ago, the lands of Utah were united under a powerful American Empire. This realm was dominated by belief in a pantheon of old gods.

Venturing out into the middle of the §YGreat Salt Lake§!, Jesus baptized his Apostle §YJohn§! and forever ensured salvation for followers of the faith. The teachings of Sacramentalism are heavily inspired by the ancient §YMormon§! faith practiced by the elders of Salt Lake City.\n\n§YOgdonian Sacramentalism§! is the oldest branch of the faith, emerging after the death of Jesus of the Salt Lake. Jesus placed his apostle §YPhillip§! in charge of the empire. During his reign, Phillip attempted to formalize many aspects of the faith. This formal account of belief was finished and published in the first §YOdgonian Bible§!. In his old age, Phillip entrusted religious leadership to a council of wise elders in the city of Ogden. Ever since this time, the council of Ogden has guided the faithful and prevented heresy."

Peter and his flock followed the savior’s instructions and carved a mighty realm out of the tribes of the region. In this sublime place, all were treated as priests and allowed to worship according to their own whims. This angered the §YOgdonian Council§! who had attempted to formalize belief. Over the centuries, these two groups drifted apart in relations and practices.

Sometimes referred to as the Earth Mother or Thea, the Heavenly Mother is a figure throughout all Sacramental religions who is believed to be the wife of God the Father. Theanites give particular worship to this being due to her connection to the earth.\n\nTheanism came about as a fusion between the old §YTayr§! faith of the §YMetis Empire§! and Sacramentalism. Tayr prioritized the practice of crystal rituals, the alignment of chakras, and the bending of energy through a practice known as Reiki. In the twilight years of the empire, Sacramental missionaries were allowed to venture into the nation and spread their faith. Their methods of blending traditional Sacramental tales with those of the Tayr led to the formation of Theanism. Thea became the Heavenly Mother and covens turned into priesthoods. The contemporary Theanite faith still holds many vestiges of their old beliefs."

Utopia can be achieved through either work, living by Collectivist principles, or simply believing its existence. The exact manifestation of Utopia  is also vague. Some believe it to be a state of society, one in which every individual is united in bliss. Others believe it to be a physical place, one where those who work hard will be allowed to rest after they die.\n\nCollectivism originated from the west, in a region called Rusland. Within a five book epic called §YThe Manifesto§!, the Rus lay out the history of the Collectivist faith and its subsequent rise to prominence. Each book follows a particular Collectivist and their attempts to achieve Utopia. Eventually, the Rus migrated to the east into Alaska and brought The Manifesto with them. Their descendants make up the current population of the region."

 OLDTIMERELIGION_DESC: "At the heart of Mexico, the once powerful Catholic church is beginning to wane in influence. Founded centuries ago in Mexico City, the Tepeyac Papacy has spread its influence over an entire continent. The years of excess and peace have made church leaders weak. Their infirm hold over the faith has damaged their divine authority. Among even the most pious there are now whispers of heresy. In the darkest corners of the Catholic world, enemies of the church have begun to plot for its downfall. With Schism, Reformation, and war on the horizon, the future of Catholicism is grim."
