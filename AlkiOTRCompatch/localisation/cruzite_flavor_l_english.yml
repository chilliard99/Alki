 CRUZITE_ASPECTS_LONG: "Cruzite Aspect"
 CRUZITE_ASPECTS_SHORT: "aspect"
 solo_por_las_escrituras_cruz: "Solo Por Las Escrituras"
 desc_solo_por_las_escrituras_cruz: "The majority of Mendoza’s teachings were predicated on the belief that the scriptures are the absolute authority on religious doctrine, a concept known as “Solo por las Escrituras.” Cruzism, which emerged from Mendoza’s teachings, carries this same concept at its heart. Cruzite leaders who took actions seen as contradictory to the scripture’s contents were harshly criticized and ousted by their feverous populace. "
 buckary_cruz: "Buckary"
 desc_buckary_cruz: "As the early Cruzites grew in population, they began to attract the attention of increasingly influential individuals. Almost unanimously, these prominent religious and political figures would denounce their actions and brand their teachings as heretical. This rejection gradually soured relations between the Cruzites and rulers, leading Mendoza to draft the “Edict of Saltillo” in 1533. In the document, Mendoza railed against the rulers of the day and stated that they must be equally accountable to the laws of heaven as the paupers. As the Cruzite faith grew into its own, this form of divine rule of law was unanimously accepted as a central tenant."
 no_hay_tributacion_cruz: "No Hay Tributación"
 desc_no_hay_tributacion_cruz: "Cruzism and its foundation were tied to those that first practiced the faith. Among the first Empresians to convert were the so-called “generación perdida,” a generation of former Texan landowners who scattered themselves across Mexico in the aftermath of The Big Bluff. These self-indulgent souls were often obsessed with the legacy of their forefathers who had fought in the crusades and modeled themselves accordingly. The influence of these men on the early church brought with it a revival of the medieval Buckary, a chivalrous code followed by the Buckaroos. The wide-brimmed elders and horseback deacons typically associated with the Cruzite church can trace their existence back to these early founders."
 gospel_of_wealth_cruz: "Gospel of Wealth"
 desc_gospel_of_wealth_cruz: "Unlike the Catholic church, the monetary aspects of the Cruzite church are purely secular. There is no required tithe and it is viewed as taboo for churches to attempt to raise money through using their own labor. Yet, most churches are still able to receive proper funding through charitable donations from wealthy benefactors. The Gospel of Wealth, a concept partly inspired by Californian Despots and reinforced by Mendoza throughout his teachings, posits that it is the duty of the wealthy to provide for the institutions of the state."
 accountable_to_all_cruz: "Accountable to All"
 desc_accountable_to_all_cruz: "Some of the earliest aspects of the Cruzite faith were directly inspired by the Sacramentals and Constitutionalists of the American continent. Particularly drawing upon Ecclesial thought, Mendoza was no stranger to quoting some of his northern neighbors. However, in a treatise written near the end of his life, Mendoza denounced the Sacramentals as heretics and pointed out many flaws in the traditional recounting of American history. While this did much to assuage the fears of the general populace, his harshest critics continue to maintain that the Cruzite faith was founded on Sacramental traditions and is thus not Christian."
 american_inspiration_cruz: "American Inspiration"
 desc_american_inspiration_cruz: "While many scholars saw the Empresian Reformation as an inevitable consequence of modernization and the end of the Catholic Golden Age, traditional Cruzite churches teach that only one thing spurred most of the early followers to action: tithes. Rising inflation, caused by the tide of new world metals, led many churches in Empresia to raise the required donation from a tithe to 15% of one’s yearly income. The hardworking and weary masses, who were being unceremoniously robbed by their own church, quickly turned to Mendoza in their hour of need. Under the new Cruzite church, none would be required to give."
 la_tabla_rasa_cruz: "La Tabla Rasa"
 desc_la_tabla_rasa_cruz: "In his last treatise “Noción de Vida y de Iglesia,” Mendoza wrote extensively on what he believed should be the future direction of the Cruzite church. Particularly, Mendoza harshly criticized the foundation of denominations and further forbade the churches founded by his flock from joining together into some greater organization. It is this deathbed wish which has prevented most of the Cruzite world from forming major denominations. Instead, the faith functions as a series of independent churches scattered throughout the pious world."
 nondenominational_cruz: "Nondenominational"
 desc_nondenominational_cruz: "“La Tabla Rasa,” borrowed from the Luzite traditions, expresses the idea that one is a clean slate whose life is filled in through experience. For Cruzites, it served as a statement regarding the status of one’s soul after conversion. A sinner who lived under the laws of Tepeyac, Rome, or himself would be made anew through conversion. In a macro sense, La Tabla Rasa was used by Cruzite scholars to describe the foundation of new churches which were free from papal influences. These new institutions were built from the ground up, in a way which reflected the needs of their followers rather than any man in Tepeyac."
 encouraged_investigation_cruz: "Encouraged Investigation"
 desc_encouraged_investigation_cruz: "Cruzism quickly attracted the curious and innovative among Catholic society due to its accepting nature. While Tepeyac was quick to suppress and exile those who stumbled upon heretical discoveries, Cruzites would often attempt to find things which challenged their faith in order to better their understanding of the natural world. The interpretation of scriptures was made to fit the discoveries of the natural world instead of being restrained by tradition."
 no_time_to_wait_cruz: "No Time to Wait"
 desc_no_time_to_wait_cruz: "Purgatory was one of the first Catholic beliefs to be excised from the Cruzite faith. Mendoza firmly believed that indulgences were just another way to tax the pious men of the world, a fact which he repeatedly expressed in his many treatises. When Tepeyac finally drafted an excommunication for the Cruzites, the denial of purgatory was given its own section and rigorously challenged."
 a_cold_world_cruz: "A Cold World"
 desc_a_cold_world_cruz: "One of the greatest points of contention between the Catholic church and Cruzites comes from some of the later works of Mendoza wherein he lays out his belief in the “mundo inacabada.” Mendoza firmly believed that divine revelation was no longer possible, as the Lord had left the world alone after the flood and fall of man. If one were to live virtuously they would still be granted salvation, but the miracles of old were done. This belief still lingers in parts of the Cruzite faith, mainly in fringe churches who teach a highly individualistic form of the faith."
 bishop_abandonment_cruz: "Bishop Abandonment"
 desc_bishop_abandonment_cruz: "Out of all of the reformation faiths, the Cruzites were the cruelest to the former Catholic clergy. Outright rejecting their attempts to blend into the new church, Cruzite rulers would often exile former bishops purley due to their past association. This left many of the remaining Catholics in Cruzite lands pliable to conversion. Without the guidance of Tepeyac, all will be enlightened to the true faith."

 cruzite_events.1.t: "The Wandering Heretic"
 cruzite_events.1.d: "Troubling news has reached Mexico City about a new development in Empresia. A wandering monk going by the name Mendoza has grown in popularity due to his bizarre practice of raising crosses along major roadways. Embedded into the structure of each cross, Mendoza has etched his own wicked commandments that run counter to our teachings. Despite the best efforts of loyal Catholics in the area, he has managed to attract some followers. These cultists now devote their every waking moment to assisting Mendoza in his efforts, going so far as to abandon their previous lives and embrace a nomadic existence. Thousands of these crosses now litter the Empresian countryside, each a monument to Mendoza’s terrible ideology. We must keep a close eye on this situation, lest it develop into something which we cannot control."
 cruzite_events.1.a: "Troubling"
 cruzite_events.2.t: "Mendoza the Saint"
 cruzite_events.2.d: "Troubling news has reached [Capital.GetName] from the province of [place_where_mendoza_is.GetName]. A wandering monk by the name of Mendoza has tainted the holy reputation of the Catholic faith and spurred the unpious to heresy. Mendoza has been a known quantity to our nation ever since he began to erect massive crosses across major roadways years ago. His gaggle of religious fanatics, The Cruzites, have joined Mendoza in rejecting the authority of Tepeyac and embracing their new heretical beliefs. In a new damning proclamation, The Cruzites have officially declared their separation from the Cahtolic church and now seek to convert the feebleminded to their crooked outlook. Throughout the crazed 44 page thesis, Mendoza and his crowd of evil denounced the very foundations of our faith and declared our followers heretics. Worryingly, it seems that this rhetoric has begun to sway some of our own citizens. The province of [place_where_mendoza_is.GetName] has become a hotbed for the Cruzite heresy, spreading their false message to all those that are willing to listen. We must act quickly to snuff out this reformation, lest it tear our faith apart."
 cruzite_events.2.a: "Horror!"
 cruzite_events.3.t: "Death of Mendoza"
 cruzite_events.3.d: "The folk saint of Empresia, Mendoza, succumbed to illness today. Whatever our opinion on the man, it is undeniable that his words have deeply touched the hearts of many in our nation. For years, Mendoza was nothing more than a simple wanderer, who lived off the land and raised crosses along the roadways of Empresia. Eventually, for good or bad, the pious and curious came to follow him and listen to his ramblings. His flock grew as each day passed. They will mourn his loss. The province of [place_where_mendoza_is.GetName] has already begun the process of grieving. They will recover, in time."
 cruzite_events.3.a: "A Tragedy."
 cruzite_events.4.t: "The Cruzite Heresy."
 cruzite_events.4.d: "The heretical Mendoza has finally gone too far. The once nomadic monk has been a thorn in our side ever since he attracted a following. Just recently, in the province of [place_where_mendoza_is.GetName], Mendoza and his ilk officially broke ties with our most holy church. In their devilish declaration, the Cruzites denounced the very foundations of our faith and laid out their heretical worldview. Even more worrying, it seems that this declaration has swayed many pious Catholics to convert to the new faith. Spreading out from [place_where_mendoza_is.GetName], these Cruzites have begun to spread their crooked outlook to all those who are willing to listen. This has certainly shaken the faith of many in our rule, we must act quickly to snuff out this reformation and restore our authority."
 cruzite_events.4.a: "We must halt their message!"
 cruzite_events.5.t: "Modified Scriptures"
 cruzite_events.5.d: "Our faith is predicated on the notion that the scriptures are the sole, infallible source of divine legislation. However, some of the more seedier individuals in our nation have begun to take advantage of this fact to control the masses. An intentionally misleading translation of the Bible has begun to spread throughout our realm. Its contents run counter to the most widely accepted interpretation of the text. If left unchecked, the spread of this false text could lead many of our own pious citizens astray. The cries for action have pushed us to a point where we must make a decision. We can either involve the state in matters of religion or leave guidance to the individual."
 cruzite_events.5.a: "Restrict its spread!"
 cruzite_events.5.b: "Denounce its contents."
 cruzite_events.5.c: "Let it go."
 cruzite_events.6.t: "Decline of Buckary"
 cruzite_events.6.d: "In our modern times, the origins and practices of Buckary have come to represent a distant memory. From the ancient days of the cowboy crusaders, Buckary’s sublime rules of chivalry have guided Christian society to its greatest peaks. When our nation decided to embrace the practice of Buckary in tandem with our worship, we understood that its sensibilities may be repulsive to modern ones. However, many in our nation have come to outright reject Buckary and denounce it's supposed “antiquated” practice in the church. As the wardens of the church, it is our job to ensure that the practices of the individual are not trampled upon, yet it is obvious that our citizens are beginning to embark down the wrong path."
 cruzite_events.6.a: "It will return once again."
 cruzite_events.6.b: "Enforce it."
 cruzite_events.7.t: "Draining Funds"
 cruzite_events.7.d: "The current financial situation of our state reminds us of the importance of taxes. While our faith was founded on the principle of voluntary donations to the church, the aversion to taxation has expanded to all aspects of life. Obviously, this has proved to be a difficult problem for our nation. A population which is religiously opposed to the practice of taxation will be inclined to avoid giving their share at all costs. In order to pay off the loans of our nation, some of our administration have suggested that we force their hands. Taking on a more harsh position, we can use our resources to impose a one-time tax or even take donations from the church."
 cruzite_events.7.a: "Just a small tax."
 cruzite_events.7.b: "Take it from the churches."
 cruzite_events.7.c: "We do not need the money."
 cruzite_events.8.t: "Called to Give"
 cruzite_events.8.d: "Just as a wealthy man is called by the Lord to donate to his church, we are compelled as a wealthy nation to give a portion of our money to the clergy. Religious unity can only be maintained so long as the institutions of the church can stay afloat, which requires generous donation. In such tumultuous times such as these, it is always useful to ensure that the church remains whole. Throughout our country, our citizens call upon us to give. Let us do as is expected. Let us support those who cannot support themselves. Let us give."
 cruzite_events.8.a: "Take it from our coffers."
 cruzite_events.8.b: "Take it from the army."
 cruzite_events.8.c: "Take it from the court."
 cruzite_events.8.e: "We have nothing to give"
 cruzite_events.9.t: "Credit Where It's Due"
 cruzite_events.9.d: "The foundations of the Cruzite faith are similar to those of the American Sacramentals. This fact has tarnished our reputation in the past, leading some of our religious neighbors to outright reject our Chrisitian status. More troubling, American influence over our faith has begun to ressurge among some of our more pliable followers. We must ensure that our pious citizens are protected from this foreign influence, yet it would be sacrilegious if we were to intervene with their faith. To accomplish this aim, some of our closest religious advisors have suggested that our administration embark on a campaign of suppression against Sacramentalism."
 cruzite_events.9.a: "Supress the influence"
 cruzite_events.9.b: "Let it spread."
 cruzite_events.10.t: "Taking Accountability"
 cruzite_events.10.d: "Unlike the Catholics of old, us pious Cruzites are accountable to our people. However,  our nation's commitment to transparency and rule of law has brought forth some problems. Most notably, every time we make a mistake our populace complains and protests our rule. Of course, we could always take accountability for our actions and express regret, but that would make us look weak. Passing the buck is an easy solution. We could even ignore the problem and hope it goes away."
 cruzite_events.10.a: "It is our burden."
 cruzite_events.10.b: "Blame someone else."
 cruzite_events.10.c: "Ignore the problem."
 cruzite_events.11.t: "Moving Forward"
 cruzite_events.11.d: "The woes of rule have made [Root.Monarch.GetName] weary. Every now and again, it helps to have a fresh start. Cruzism promises a chance at rebirth. Born again, without the sins of a past life, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could be the [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] always wanted to be. Conversely, Mendoza always stressed the need to accept one’s lot. The early Cruzites always said “the hand which The Lord deals is the one intended to be held.” Let us consider this wisdom before we change ourselves completely."
 cruzite_events.11.a: "A new start."
 cruzite_events.11.b: "I am what I am."
 our_ruler_will_become_a_two_two_two.tt: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will have [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Administrative Skill set to §G1§!£adm£, Diplomatic Skill set to §G1§!£dip£, and Military Skill set to §G1§!£mil£"
 cruzite_events.12.t: "Decentralized Issues"
 cruzite_events.12.d: "Tepeyac, for all of its problems, sure knew how to run things. The centralization of the church during the Edad de Oro was a sight to behold. Bishops and priests working like cogs in one big, bureaucratic machine. Even as papacy’s influence dipped, the Catholics continued to function as a brutally efficient institution. Cruzism tore all of this down, dismantled the corruption that made the system function and decentralized religion. While the right thing to do, it has brought some problems for our new church. A prime example of this has emerged in [place_where_decentralization_will_go_well.GetName], where several churches have started to demand preferential treatment as part of their doctrine. Tired of waiting for us to take action, they have swayed the local officials of [place_where_decentralization_will_go_well.GetName] to join their cause. Any response to this situation would compromise the positions of our administration. We must consider our next move carefully."
 cruzite_events.12.a: "We have no right."
 cruzite_events.12.b: "Something must be done." 
 cruzite_events.13.t: "Between Church and State"
 cruzite_events.13.d: "Cruzism prides itself on freedom of investigation. Some of the earliest followers of the faith were men of science and philosophy, who were simply looking for a way to explore the Lord’s world in earnest. While our administration has stuck to this ideal, our citizens have been less receptive to new discoveries that shake their faith. One of our nation’s finest academics has recently published a treatise on the nature of belief, one which questions the very foundations of our church. Many throughout our nation now call upon our administration to denounce this work and prevent its spread."
 cruzite_events.13.a: "Reprimand them!"
 cruzite_events.13.b: "Wonderful!"
 cruzite_events.14.t: "Apathetic Populace"
 cruzite_events.14.d: "A world without an active God is one in which there can be no true justice. If the lord is not working to execute his laws and dictate his will, who is to say that evil will not prevail? Cruzite philosophers have routinely found clean ways of solving these issues, claiming that the world which God created was set up in such a way that the righteous will always be given what is due. Despite this, many in our nation cannot help but feel fundamentally lost with such a depressing thought of abandonment. Perhaps it is time for our faith to embrace a more positive outlook, lest we fall into the slums of despair."
 cruzite_events.14.a: "Inspire them to continue."
 cruzite_events.14.b: "Revoke our statement."
 cruzite_events.14.c: "Let them wallow."
 cruzite_events.15.t: "Jobless Clergy"
 cruzite_events.15.d: "The clean Cruzite slate which Mendoza envisioned has come to pass in our nation, yet there are still lingering influences of the old Tepeyac order. Bishops and priests, who once guided the pious Catholics of our nation, have been left to wander throughout our nation’s countryside. Without purpose, they have become a burden on our state. Perhaps it would be for the best if we employed them into our own ranks and gave them some purpose once again."
 cruzite_events.15.a: "Employ them."
 cruzite_events.15.b: "They will find meaning eventually."
 cruzite_events.16.t: "Indulging the Faithful"
 cruzite_events.16.d: "Some of our most clever advisors have suggested that our administration take advantage of the remaining Catholics within our borders. Our nation has fully embraced Cruzite principles, which entails our rejection of purgatory’s existance. Following from this, any indulgences gathered by the church would serve no purpose and would be received under false pretenses. However, the Catholics in our nation still earnestly believe in this place after death. If we were to covertly sell indulgences to these Catholic communities, we could raise funds to further glorify the Lord under the Cruzite church."
 cruzite_events.16.a: "Sell them."
 cruzite_events.16.b: "We cannot con our own citizens!."
