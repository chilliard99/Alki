 jewish_events.1.d: "Through the fires of war, we have conquered the jewish holy site of [holy_site_lost_jewish.GetName]. New Canaan has historically been united under different jewish dynasties until their eventual dissolution at the hands of the Canadian emperor. Now one of their holiest of cities is under our control. This will no doubt disturb the different jewish rulers and citizens of this continent, whether we ease their fears and move forward towards interfaith cooperation is up for us to decide. For now, let us enjoy our victory!"
 jewish_events.1.a: "Victory!"
 jewish_events.2.t: "Loss of [holy_site_lost_jewish.GetName]"
 jewish_events.2.d: "A horror has come upon the jewish faith as the holy site of [holy_site_lost_jewish.GetName] has fallen to [From.GetName]. During times such as these, we must be strong in our convictions and have hope for a future free from strife. It is in moments such as these that our faith is fundamentally tested. This tension already has put our populace and administration at unease, let us ensure that it does not spiral out of control."
 jewish_events.2.a: "Horror!"
 jewish_events.3.t: "Reconquest of [holy_site_regained_jewish.GetName]"
 jewish_events.3.d: "We have managed to retake the holy site of [holy_site_regained_jewish.GetName] through the heat of battle. For generations, they will speak of this wondrous victory for the jewish faith. Where once was a shattered city, fallen to the evil machinations of sacramental influence and islamic rhetoric, we will rebuild a great center of faith. Before the inevitable task of reconstruction, let us take a moment to relish in our victory and celebrate."
 jewish_events.3.a: "Victory!"
 jewish_events.4.t: "Reconquest of [holy_site_regained_jewish.GetName]"
 jewish_events.4.d: "Word has just reached our nation that the holy site of [holy_site_regained_jewish.GetName] has been retaken by [From.GetName]. This marks a wonderful moment for the Jewish faith as we attempt to claw back what was stolen from us by Canadian influences centuries ago. Throughout our realm and administration, this news has already begun to reaffirm the faith of many and rebuild their confidence in our ultimate success. Let us take a moment to celebrate this victory and the hope for a pious future."
 jewish_events.4.a: "Wonderful!"
 jewish_events.5.t: "Warden of Canaan"
 jewish_events.5.d: "Centuries ago the New Canaanites carved a mighty civilization along the east coast. Through the collapse of the Canadian and Japanese empires, the New Canaanites endured. It was only with the intervention of the infernal Lafayettes and their desire for total hegemony that the Jewish faith was left without direction and dwindling by the start of the 15th century. Despite this state, and against all odds, we have managed to claw back the holy cities of Manhattan, Cleveland, Washington, Philadelphia, and Buffalo. Through the fire of war and strokes of diplomacy we have brought the Jewish faith back from the brink. As we look towards the future, it is important to remember this past and embrace its influence. Tales of the old Canaan will terrify our enemies and embolden our populace. These legends will carry our influence beyond, so that those throughout the world know of our legitimacy. Let all those who wish to hurt the jewish faith know, there is a new warden of Canaan. "
 jewish_events.5.a: "United, once again."
 jewish_events.6.t: "Growth of [jewish_holy_site_to_grow.GetName]"
 jewish_events.6.d: "The holy city of [jewish_holy_site_to_grow.GetName] has grown under our reign as different groups throughout the realm flock to be within its sacred walls. During the old empire of Canaan, these holy cities were the largest on the East Coast and served as central gathering points for believers and gentiles alike. After the collapse of Canaan, these cities fell into disrepair and corruption as Canadian officials employed harsh laws and oppressed minorities. Now that they are back under our control, these holy sites are beginning to flourish back into their former selves."
 jewish_events.6.a: "We must invest"
 jewish_events.6.b: "We must expand our administration"
 jewish_events.7.t: "Pirates of Manhattan"
 jewish_events.7.d: "New Canaan was an efficient state with powerful infrastructure. This internal cohesion was upset with its collapse by the hands of the sacramental Canadians, which led to a total degradation of the region’s moral character. In order to survive, many Canaanites turned to thievery, prostitution, and piracy in order to surivive in the collapsing state. The most notable amongst these pirates were the Libertalians of New York, who overthrew the Canadian puppets of Levant and implemented their own pirate council. Now that we control Manhattan, we must make a decision on the legality of their actions. While piracy could certainly prove lucrative for our nation, it could very well devalue our own trade and prevent Manhattan from flourishing into a powerful trading hub. "
 jewish_events.7.a: "We would never stoop to such a low!"
 jewish_events.7.b: "Do I get a hat?"
 jewish_events.8.t: "City That Never Sleeps"
 jewish_events.8.d: "The city of Manhattan has served as a key center of production for centuries due to its large population, prime location, and talented winemakers. This prided efficiency has melded itself into local culture, creating a fast paced lifestyle for many locals. In a time before the establishment of the New Canaanite civilization, Manhattan was known as the “City That Never Sleeps.” This fitting title has passed down through the ages and become symbolic of local values. Now that we control this key holy site, we are enjoying some of the benefits of its rich traditions. If we were to promote a particular cultural tradition amongst the New Yorkers, it may hone the city’s production into a particular direction and further bolster its output."

 jewish_events.9.t: "Holy Trade"
 jewish_events.9.d: "Cleveland serves an important role as the primary Great Lakes port of New Canaan. It was the first city which Peter traveled to when establishing diplomatic ties between the Canaanites and the burgeoning Canadian empire. The city’s rich maritime tradition has created a citizenry of hardy sailors, yet the people of Cleveland style themselves more after their Canadian and Turkish neighbors than Canaanite. Generations of settlement and migration surrounding the city had slowly entrenched the false sacramental and islamic faiths years before the collapse of New Canaan. Now that the city is back under proper control, it is time that we turn the tools of settlement and commercial influence against those that converted Cleveland in the first place. Our traders will explicitly try to spread the jewish faith amongst those in the Great Lakes in an attempt to expand our influence abroad. We have already made gains in [random_jewish_province_to_convert.Owner.GetName], specifically in the province of [random_jewish_province_to_convert.GetName]."

 jewish_events.10.t: "Jewish Traders"
 jewish_events.10.d: "News has reached our capital about an occurrence in [random_jewish_province_to_convert.GetName]. Apparently, a local collection of different community leaders in the province have started to mandate that their populace follow jewish traditions. While the jewish population of [random_jewish_province_to_convert.GetName] had been growing for years due to the influence of traders from Cleveland, this turn of events is profoundly unprecedented. Of course, we could force them to stop this practice, but that might trigger an outright revolt! Let us consider our options carefully in order to solve this crisis in an efficient manner."
 jewish_events.10.a: "Heathens!"
 jewish_events.10.b: "Let them be."
 jewish_events.11.t: "Rebuilding Washington"
 jewish_events.11.d: "Washington was once the capital of New Canaan and the most diverse city on the American continent, yet it has fallen into disrepair due to many sieges and poor management. The city saw immense fighting during Fredrick Lafayette’s war for New Canaan, with the young emperor engaging in a four year long siege after the rest of the Canaanites capitulated. During Fredrick’s War, Washington was on the front lines of the Antebellan campaigns. Usman I, leader of the early Ohio Sultanate, pressed the men, women, and children of Washington into service for his force’s advance into the north. This essentially halved the city’s population, as the enslaved Columbians were scattered throughout New Canaan, Antebellum, Ohio, and England. The stories of this devastation can be seen in the burned buildings and orphanages of Washington’s streets. As the warden of this city, we must do something in order to restore its ancient legacy."
 jewish_events.11.a: "Washington will be great once again."
 jewish_events.11.b: "The pious spread."
 jewish_events.12.t: "Diversity of Thought"
 jewish_events.12.d: "While the diversity of perspectives can often lead to conflict, it can just as easily benefit a culture and contribute to advancement. Washington is a city of diverse background, mostly due to its mythical status abroad as a city of riches. Throughout history, many different groups have traveled to Washington in order to make their fotrune. Among the people of Washington, there are the ancestors of Cuban barons, Californian electors, and Inuit wanders. Washington’s diversity has routinely made it a city which is powerful for its ability to foster diverse ideas and be on the cutting edge of progress. Now, more than ever, this culture presents itself as innovation appears from all corners of the globe."
 jewish_events.12.a: "Washington will be great once again."
 jewish_events.13.t: "City of Liberty"
 jewish_events.13.d: "When Peter first arrived in Canada with his flock, he brought with him a sizable army of not so faithful patriotic soldiers who were meant to help protect his newly established empire. After his death, many of these soldiers flocked to the east coast and were welcomed by the pious New Canaanites. According to traditional Patriotic beliefs, the lands of New Canaan were full of important holy sites. Specifically, Philadelphia held a high amount of latent “liberty” which patriots flocked to. Though the patriots are long gone, this individualistic culture has made the Philedalphians difficult to manage for weaker monarchs. Luckily, our administration has managed to twist this message into one that can benefit us. "
 jewish_events.13.a: "We promote liberty."
 jewish_events.13.b: "The people promote liberty."
 jewish_events.14.t: "University Culture"
 jewish_events.14.d: "Philadelphia was once the capital of science and innovation on the east coast due to its vast network of universities. Turkish, Iowan, and even Canadian scholars would flock to the city in order to visit its vast libraries and learn from some of the Great Lake’s most prolific scholars. While most of this innovation came to an end with the eventual decline of the New Canaanites, under our administration the universities have started to recover. As the new warden of Philadelphia, we could use our influence in order to direct their discovery for the good of the Jewish faith."

 jewish_events.14.b: "Promote Analysis."
 jewish_events.14.c: "Promote Reflection."
 jewish_events.15.t: "Buffalo Glasses"
 jewish_events.15.d: "The city of Buffalo is most well known amongst foreigners for its beautiful glass designs. For centuries the city perfected its glassworks for use in Shabbat, crafting intricate designs meant to fully display the city’s devotion to their faith. However, as more Ecclesial settlers flooded into the city, the glassworks increasingly became more related to the sacramental faith and luxury items. Now that we have retaken the city, we have been left with these wonderful glassworks. With this control comes a pivotal decision regarding what to do with the material. Should we allow artists to express themselves as they once did or sell the glassworks abroad?"
 jewish_events.15.a: "Sell it to the masses."
 jewish_events.15.b: "Give it to the artists."
 jewish_events.16.t: "Holy Cities Shattered"
 jewish_events.16.d: "The Jewish faith lies at a careful precipice. For centuries, the New Canaanites ruled over these lands and ensured prosperity amongst all of her people. Then, the Canadians ruined it all. Under the administration of a young Fredrick Lafayette, the ailing New Canaanite Empire was shattered in a swift war. The Jewish faith now lies as a shadow of its former self, slowly fading into obscurity with the lack of several key holy cities. Despite this, not all is lost. We still hold onto one of these holy cities, which we can use to lay claim to all of the others. In this dark hour, we will restore what was so cruelly taken from us and become the true heirs of New Canaan!"
 jewish_events.16.a: "We are the true heirs."
 jewish_events.17.t: "Laurentian Navy"
 jewish_events.17.d: "Our reconquest of the city of Buffalo has allowed us to expand our naval presence right outside of the Canadian doorstep. During Fredrick Lafayette’s invasion of New Canaan, the mighty Canadian navy completely shattered the measly Canaanite one. Frederick pressed this naval supremacy to cut off the valuable Great Lakes and Tidewater trade from the Canaanite port cities, essentially strangling the commercial engine of the empire. In order to survive in spite of this new age, we must learn from the mistakes of our ancestors. Focusing on a particular naval aspect and constructing a large fleet to patrol the St.Lawrence would go far in accomplishing this aim."
 jewish_events.17.a: "We must focus on recuritment"

 jewish_events.17.c: "We must focus on our morale"
 jewish_events.18.t: "Jewish population of [jewish_prov_for_grow_pop.GetName]"
 jewish_events.18.d: "The city of [jewish_prov_for_grow_pop.GetName] is a holy site for the Jewish faith. These “holy sites” were key cities once part of the New Canaanite Empire. Their religious nature attracts many of the jewish faith, which in turn has created a partial problem for us. As more jewish people begin to flock to [jewish_prov_for_grow_pop.GetName], the city has increasingly become more aligned with Judaism. If they are allowed to continue to expand their influence, they might convert the entire city to their heathen practices. Of course, we could intervene and turn them away, but what would that signal for the other minority populations of our state? We must consider our next move carefully, with regard to the true faith."
 jewish_events.18.a: "Let them grow."
 jewish_events.18.b: "Stop their spread."
 jewish_events.19.t: "Jews Face Persecution"
 jewish_events.19.d: "The small jewish population of our realm faces violent persecution by members of our very own faith. Local groups have risen up to terrorize our jewish population by attacking their believers and torching their religious buildings. While they do practice a heathen sect, this level of righteous violence is unprecedented by individual members of our state. Many in our own administration are calling upon us to take action and protect our jewish minority, but would that truly be the right thing to do? We are now required to make a difficult decision for our state, to protect the heathens and risk angering our populace or continue to let them face persecution."
 jewish_events.19.a: "We will protect them!"
 jewish_events.19.b: "It is not our matter."

Through violence against their property, bodies, and faith they have been forced to leave their homes in order to live a better life beyond. With their departure, there is no doubt that our province of [starting_prov_flee_jewish.GetName] will return to the one true faith. Consequently, the nation of [place_where_jews_are_fleeing_to.Owner.GetName] will now be forced to bear the burden of our inaction. Hopefully, they do not treat these heathens too kindly."

 jewish_events.21.d: "The Jewish population of [starting_prov_flee_jewish.GetName], fleeing religious persecution, has come to settle in [place_where_jews_are_fleeing_to.GetName]. Our administration is split on what to do about this new fact, given that they are here and will likely attempt to settle in our own borders. Of course, we could use the fact that they are heathens as a justification for kicking them out, yet this would likely provoke a conflict. Whatever our choice, let us keep the one true faith in mind while making it."
 jewish_events.21.a: "Welcome them!"
 jewish_events.21.b: "Crush them!"
 jewish_events.22.t: "Rabbi Offers Assistance"
 jewish_events.22.d: "Among the jewish population of [province_for_the_advisor_jewish.GetName], a local rabbi has become prominent for their wisdom and local efficacy. Due to the state of jewish persecution, communities like [province_for_the_advisor_jewish.GetName] are unable to prosper like the rest of our realm under normal conditions. However, this rabbi has managed to negotiate among other local leaders and raise their own community to a higher standard. After their success in [province_for_the_advisor_jewish.GetName], they have come to the capital in order to offer assistance in our own administration."
 jewish_events.22.a: "A wonderful addition to our administration."
 jewish_events.22.b: "They would better serve their community."
 jewish_events.23.t: "Memories of Canaan"
 jewish_events.23.d: "New Canaan, an empire like no other. In centuries past, New Canaan was the premiere power on the east coast. Outliving the Japanese and American empires, the New Canaanites were a fixture of the north. However, over the course of a few generations, this legacy faded away. The arrival of the Canadians and their settlement of the east coast gradually replaced most of the local jewish populations and spread the Ecclesial branch of Sacramentalism. This growing religious schism and a stagnating economy made the New Canaanites the perfect victim for the upstart Canadian emperor Frederick Lafayette. Frederick shattered the empire in a swift war, proclaiming himself the supreme warden of “jewdom.” Old references to the Canaanite empire were shattered, holy cities were violated, and the remaining jewish population was persecuted by many of the hand picked Canadian rulers. Yet, the dream of a Newer Canaan is not lost. We are in a prime position to reclaim our ancient heritage and once again proclaim the Empire of New Canaan. Let every heart in New Canaan ring true and let the memories pour forth!"
 jewish_events.23.a: "We will be united once again!"
 jewish_events.23.b: "It is long gone."
 jewish_events.24.t: "Discovery of Israel"
 jewish_events.24.d: "Far beyond the sea, we have discovered the lost land of Israel. For centuries, jewish scholars thought that Israel was lost with the great flood, but the evidence is conclusive. At first, most believed that this “discovery” was a sacramental lie falsified to test our faith. Yet, we stand corrected in our convictions. What this means for the future of the jewish faith remains contested, yet for the moment we are able to bask in the popularity that comes with confirming the rumor."
 jewish_events.24.a: "Facinating"
 jewish_events.25.t: "Sacramental Relations"
 jewish_events.25.d: "Jewish-Sacramental relations have been rocky ever since the arrival of Peter in Canada. Before Peter’s arrival, New Canaan was the uncontested power of the Great Lakes. For centuries, the Canadian state was allowed to expand and prosper with New Canaan’s blessing. Even when Ecclesials poured into the Canaanite borders and populated its various cities, the empire did little to stop them. Despite all of this goodwill, the Canadian emperor Fredrick Lafayette decided to invade the Canaanites and suppress the jewish faith. Ever since this action, the relation between sacramentals and jews has deteriorated to the point of outright persecution. However, this does not need to be the way that this stays. One of our own neighbors, [sacramental_nation_to_reach_out_to.GetName] might be the key to improving Sacramental-Jewish relations. If we reach out to them in a gesture of goodwill, the rest of the abrahamic world might just take notice."

 jewish_events.26.d: "We have recently received an invitation from [From.GetName] in an effort to improve relations between the sacramental and jewish faiths. For centuries, both of these groups lived in peace under Canaanite and eventually Canadian rule, but growing tensions have come to tear them apart. Whether this status quo continues depends on our actions here. If we were to accept their gesture of goodwill and visit their state, we will no doubt signal the normalization of jewish and sacramental nations. However, we are under no obligation to do so and can instead scorn their invitation to embarrass them on the global stage."

In addition to our new isolation, we have also been embarrassed on the global stage for our attempt. Let us hope that they come to their senses in time."
 jewish_events.28.a: "Damn them!"
 jewish_events.29.t: "The Tolerant Faith"
 jewish_events.29.d: "Unlike most other religions, Judaism makes no attempt to outright convert its followers. Individual members of the faith feel no obligation to go forth and proselytize or enforce their own religion on others. While individual nations may attempt to homogenize their populace by converting heathens, this crucial aspect of the jewish faith makes it unique for its level of tolerance. Some within our own state feel this very acceptance now, as they continue their heathen practices free from religious persecution. While not all of our brothers and sisters abroad can attest to this same treatment under different regimes, we must always remember to define ourselves differently than the heathen yoke."
 jewish_events.29.a: "We accept all."
 jewish_events.30.t: "Beth din"
 jewish_events.30.d: "The beth din serves as a court of judgment for all matters relating to our faith. Throughout our realm, different disputes eventually arise that require a number of wise believers to pass judgment on. The judges that make up a typical beth din are selected by our own administration, ensuring that they remain loyal to our interests. Yet, one a number of these different judges have come to side against us in a key matter. Through this action, they have essentially made the public question our own religious wisdom. The punishment for such an action must be severe, but the cost of replacing all of these men may be too steep for us to afford."
 jewish_events.30.a: "Replace them."
 jewish_events.30.b: "Keep them."
 jewish_events.31.t: "Sect Tensions"
 jewish_events.31.d: "Within Judaism, there are two primary sects which have managed to survive following the collapse of the New Canaanite Empire. The first are the Orthodox, who side more clearly with traditional interpretations of jewish law. Conversely, the Reformists argue for a more fluid interpretation of jewish law and adaptation to modern sensibilities. Ever since the dawn of the Canaanite empire, these groups have been fiercely divided on matters of doctrine. For this reason, it is often unwise for a ruler to support either side, lest they offend some portion of their populace. However, we have recently been cornered by a debate on the matter and must choose a side."
 jewish_events.31.a: "We side with the Orthodox."
 jewish_events.31.b: "We side with the Reformists."
 jewish_events.32.t: "Shtiebel Gone Wild"
 jewish_events.32.d: "The Shtiebel serves as a less formal gathering place for various jewish communities throughout our realm. However, recently in the province of [shtiebel_gone_wild.GetName] a normal gathering lost control and evolved into a destructive celebration. Citizens from throughout [shtiebel_gone_wild.GetName], even some gentiles, joined into the party and started to get rambunctious. While this is all fine, the problem comes with the aftermath. The Shtiebel, and its respective corner of town, has been completely trashed. While this would typically be a matter resolved by the local administration, we have instead been called to rule on the matter due to the sheer amount of damage."
 jewish_events.32.a: "Clean up the mess"
 jewish_events.32.b: "What a great night!"
 jewish_events.33.t: "Kashrut Complications"
 jewish_events.33.d: "One of our advisors has recently been found to be in violation of the jewish dietary laws. There are few severe punishments for disobeying Kashrut, but our own advisor has refused to accept any punishment. This has evolved into a national scandal which may damage our administration’s reputation. While we can simply ask them to leave, their presence in our court may be crucial to our current aims. On the other hand, ignoring their mistakes could very well lead to a loss of our own national image."
 jewish_events.33.a: "Ask them to leave."
 jewish_events.33.b: "It was just a mistake."
 jewish_events.34.t: "Popular Synagogue"
 jewish_events.34.d: "Our community building efforts in [popular_synagogue_province.GetName] have gone successfully as our synagogue has spurred expansion in the community. Synagogues serve as important gathering places for jewish communities, being a place where the faithful come to socialize and worship. Some of the most impressive structures built by the New Canaanites that still stand to this day were massive synagogues. While our own construction pales in comparison to these ancient relics, it still has provided [popular_synagogue_province.GetName] a place to plan its own improvements."

We have learned from the lessons of Washington, when the Sultan of Ohio enslaved and slaughtered our people and the lessons of Albany, when Fredrick massacred an entire city. In order to defeat such a foe, we will need to carefully focus our military on our enemy’s weakness. Let us take a moment amongst this chaos to meditate and choose what will serve us best in the future."

 jewish_events.38.d: "While the city of [goldem_siege_resisting_jewish.GetName] was under siege by our current foe, a group of rabbis gathered together to create a golem. Made from a thick clay, the golem has defended the city against the invading forces by destroying siege weapons and startling enemy cavalry. This is the story which we are hearing from [goldem_siege_resisting_jewish.GetName], whether it is true is another matter. Stranger things have happened."

 jewish_events.39.t: "The Great Mockery"
 jewish_events.39.d: "We live in a new age of mysticism and spirituality which has sent many different religions into crisis. Despite this, we have managed to endure and hold onto our own traditional beliefs. Yet, we have somehow not earned respect for this action as the Theanites have made a mockery of our beliefs. In their endless quest to generalize and adapt all other faiths of the world to their own crooked outlook, they have stolen aspects of our own Kabbalah and twisted it. May they come to their senses and realize what an embarrassment they have become."

 jewish_events.40.t: "Hitbodedut"
 jewish_events.40.d: "Reflection is necessary for any well rounded ruler. Everyone has something they can do to improve themselves, and Hitbodedut can take one closer to their ideal. Reflecting on the nature of our administration is a common occurrence, but truly pondering the questions of greater existence is what separates the ruler from the leader. In order to more efficiently serve our people and our God, we must take a moment to reflect and see what insights we can gain about our own life. For just a second, let us ignore all of the chaos of rule and think."
