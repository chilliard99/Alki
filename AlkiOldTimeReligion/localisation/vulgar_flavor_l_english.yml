 minority_defense_sp: "Minority Defense"
 minority_defense_sp_desc: "From the ancient city of Rome, now called New Eden by the Sacramental Heathens, the Latin papacy ruled over all of Christendom for thousands of years. After the flood, our faith was reduced to almost nothing. For centuries, the remaining Catholics were subjugated by the Sacramental Ogdonians. Many abandoned their faith in order to join the ranks of Italian society, yet some of the most pious remained strong in their convictions. Those that stood steady were branded as heathens, Vulgar for their proclivity to engage in what the Ogdonians thought sinful. We adopted this as a mark of pride and continued to resist their overwhelming rule."
 italian_legacy_sp: "Italian Legacy"
 italian_legacy_sp_desc: "Born from the minds of Vulgar Romanos, Stato Pontificio has consistently been entrenched in Italian philosophy. The peninsula’s status as an important crossroads between east and west exposed it to many diverse viewpoints and burgeoning technologies. Coupled with our current African populace, this legacy has led our nation to be more accepting of possibly heretical ideas. Taking the best elements of what the heathens have to offer and rejecting what is detrimental to our state gives us a unique advantage against our more rigid neighbors."
 keyholder_sp: "Keyholder"
 keyholder_sp_desc: "A fundamental pillar of our nation is the apostolic succession of our ruler. Unlike the disconnected papacy at Tepeyac, our pope derives his legitimacy directly from those that reigned before the flood. Upon the conquest of Rome in the 12th century by the Catholic crusaders, the ravenous wolf of Mexico City excommunicated our practice and attempted to suppress our message. No longer will this stand, every faithful heart will be returned to the right path."
 called_to_serve_sp: "Called to Serve"
 called_to_serve_sp_desc: "As the head of Christendom, we enjoy a special reverence among our subjects which is not shared by other rulers. Most notable among these benefits is the fervor that our status provides when at war. Many men who would typically shy away from combat are quick to defend their faith. Should we come into conflict with any state that threatens Christendom, we can expect support from all corners of our nation."

 aid_from_abroad_sp_desc: "The newly converted rulers of this continent have been generous enough to grant us a plot of land to build our church upon. As our church grows, we can expect more support in the expansion of our state from those that join us. With their aid, our humble church may one day come to rival the power of Tepeyac and return the scales to a proper balance."
 the_glorious_return_sp: "The Glorious Return"
 the_glorious_return_sp_desc: "Seeing the infirm rule of the pope in Mexico City, a procession of Vulgars traveled south in order to reach out to the kings of Africa and settle in their lands. For years, they resided in foreign borders and quietly practiced the Vulgar faith under Catholic thumbs. With the tide of heresies impacting the Catholic church and the continued decline of papal authority in the 15th century, many rulers have come to view our succession and legitimacy as a solution to their religious woes. We will continue to pursue a strategy of education and expansion, so that all may know of our legitimacy as the true papacy."
 northern_conundrum_sp: "Northern Conundrum"
 northern_conundrum_sp_desc: "The first interaction between the Vulgar and Mexican churches came during the 12th century, when Catholic crusaders began their conquest of Italy. Due to dissatisfaction with their Italian overlords, the Vulgars of Rome crafted a deal with the Catholics to hand over the Holy City. The exact nature of this deal is heavily disputed between Vulgars and Catholics, with the former believing that they would be given their own independent state in the aftermath of the war. However, once peace was established, the Pope of Tepeyac excommunicated all members of the Vulgar church and called for their exile from the Catholic world. Careful negotiations between the Vulgars and the Italian King Lucas II managed to prevent an outright war, but many remain bitter over the broken treaty."

 vulgar_events.1.t: "Thorn in Our Side"
 vulgar_events.1.d: "As if we didn’t have enough problems, another one has sprouted in the north. Word has just reached [Root.Capital.GetName] that the so-called “Latin Pope” has ventured into Africa in order to sow dissent amongst the local rulers. While we are the most established Catholics in Christendom, we are not the only ones to claim this title. The Vulgars are a dwindling group of heretics who worship the supposed bishop of Rome. They believe that our papacy is false, coming from a series of bishops rather than the genuine cardinals of the pre-flood church. Of course, they have no proof for their claims. Catholic scholars have routinely debunked their spurious objections to our authority, yet they continue to paint an alluring picture for the uneducated. The arrival of the Vulgars could prove troublesome for our faith, as they will likely cause tension for the citizens of Africa. However, if we manage to remain strong and resist heresy, there will be no reason for the pious of the north to abandon their faith. We must keep a watchful eye on this situation and see how it develops. We cannot let the Catholic world fall into a schism."
 vulgar_events.1.a: "We must remain vigilent!"
 vulgar_events.2.t: "The Vulgar Pope"
 vulgar_events.2.d: "News has reached [Root.Capital.GetName] of a special arrival in our borders: the so-called “Latin Pope.” He is the religious leader of the Vulgars, a Christian tradition which accepts the primacy of the bishop of Rome rather than Mexico City. Interestingly, he has arrived in the province of [place_where_the_vulgar_pope_is_gonna_stay.GetName] with no intention of harm. While the papacy has stated that his intention is to sow doubt amongst the rulers of Africa and spread heresy, it seems that these Vulgars are simply fleeing Italy due to Ogdonian oppression. As brothers in Christ, we are obliged to help them in their resistance against the Sacramental threat and let them reside in our borders. We must keep a watchful eye on their activities, lest they change their mind and turn on us."
 vulgar_events.2.a: "Interesting."
 vulgar_events.3.t: "A Northern Challenger"
 vulgar_events.3.d: "Our papal rival in the north has finally decided to play his cards. Ever since the Vulgars arrived on this continent, they have sowed the seeds of doubt into the minds of once pious men. Through bribing and worming their way into the administrations of the north, the Vulgars have entrenched themselves as a necessary and influential organization. In the early hours of the morning, the local lords of [place_where_the_vulgar_pope_is_gonna_stay.GetName] were puppeted to abandon their faith and denounce our papacy. From corrupted community to community, this plague of heresy will spread until no true Catholics remain. The faithful rulers of Africa will no doubt resist the temptation to convert during these troubling times, but we fear that they may be overwhelmed by the demands of their citizens. As heresies continue to spring up all around this continent, we risk having our resources stretched too thin. We must now decide whether we should divert our attention away from the Mendozans to deal with this threat or put it in the hands of fate."
 vulgar_events.3.a: "Something must be done!"
 vulgar_events.4.t: "Pope of the Latins"
 vulgar_events.4.d: "An interesting development has emerged in [place_where_the_vulgar_pope_is_gonna_stay.GetName]. The once faithful lords of the province have converted to the Vulgar faith and denounced the papacy of Tepeyac. Vulgars are a peculiar sort. Their version of Catholicism is similar to ours, but with slight differences. This is mostly a consequence of their religious head, the so-called “Vulgar Pope” who claims to hold true primacy over Christendom. While they have remained quiet in the province of [place_where_the_vulgar_pope_is_gonna_stay.GetName], many in our administration can’t help but believe the Vulgars had something to do with the sudden change. Whether these lords converted due to the apparent weakness of the Catholic faith or the seedy dealings of a corrupt heretic, their actions have thrown our nation into chaos. Across the countryside, our citizens are abandoning Tepeyac and demanding that we do the same. Of course, we are not blind to the possibly valid claims of the Vulgar Pope. Their alternative to the weak and infirm Tepeyac papacy is alluring, perhaps it is for the best that we abandon the south and embrace something more unique in the north. After all, what has Mexico City ever done for us?"
 vulgar_events.4.a: "It is the true papacy!"
 vulgar_events.4.b: "Heresy!"
 vulgar_events.4.c: "We hold the keys."
 vulgar_events.5.t: "The Latins"
 vulgar_events.5.d: "Word has reached our borders of a recent budding heresy. In the nation of [place_where_the_vulgar_pope_is_gonna_stay.Owner.GetName], an interesting development has occurred regarding Vulgar Catholicism. The Vulgars are a peculiar sort. Their version of the faith shares only slight differences from ours. These alterations emerge from their separate papacy, which at one time was based out of the city of Rome. Within the last century, most Vulgars have migrated into Africa. Specifically, they have settled in the province of [place_where_the_vulgar_pope_is_gonna_stay.GetName] and eked out quiet lives. Yet, with the waning influence of Tepeyac’s authority, the Vulgar claim to primacy has garnered more attention. Some of our own neighbors have considered conversion and many of their citizens have embraced the Latin faith in full. Their alternative to the weak and infirm Tepeyac papacy is alluring, perhaps it is for the best that we abandon the south and embrace something more unique in the north. After all, what has Mexico City ever done for us?"
 vulgar_events.5.a: "The True Papacy"
 vulgar_events.5.b: "Heresy!"
 vulgar_events.6.t: "A Latin State"
 vulgar_events.6.d: "Just as the pope of Tepeyac holds earthly territory, so too should the Pope of the Latins hold his own land. We have recently been approached by His Eminence with a request to transfer one of our provinces over to his rule. Of course, doing so will greatly increase our sway over the Vulgar Church and provide our administration with a direct connection with the papacy. The only catch is that the papacy requested the province of [place_where_pope_will_stay_latin_state.GetName]. This province is valuable to our administration and parting with it could very well disrupt our rule. While we could always deny his request, what message would that send to our citizens?"
 vulgar_events.6.a: "With Honor."
 vulgar_events.6.b: "We have no land to give!"
 vulgar_events.6.c: "We hold the keys."
 vulgar_events.7.t: "Old Bishops"
 vulgar_events.7.d: "While we have converted our administration to Vulgar Catholicism, there are still many members of the old faith within our borders. Among them are the old Catholic bishops, who still bitterly cling to the authority of Tepeyac. As Vulgars, it is our duty to enlighten the misguided of our state and bring them to see the error of their ways. If we were to force the conversion of these bishops, it is likely that they would sway several citizens of their diocese to join them in the new faith. On the other hand, it would be much easier to simply replace them with more pliable Vulgar priests."
 vulgar_events.7.a: "Get rid of them!"
 vulgar_events.7.b: "Have them convert."
 vulgar_events.8.t: "Conditioned Thoughts"
 vulgar_events.8.d: "Our faith separates itself from the church of Tepeyac in many ways, chief among them being the difference in papal rulings. While we have done well to convert many of our citizens to the laws of the new church, some still cling to the old traditions as well. Correcting their behavior will prove difficult, as the Catholic laws have entrenched themselves into our nation over the course of generations. Among the solutions proposed by our religious advisors two stand out as the most effective. The first focuses on merging our current laws with the old. Adopting some of the more inoffensive rulings of the Tepeyac papacy could go far in making our faith more palatable to the heretics. The second relies upon pure force. Outlawing these Catholic practices and enforcing our own beliefs might temporarily cause some headaches for our state, but would go far in ensuring that future generations practice a pure Vulgar Catholicism."
 vulgar_events.8.a: "Merge with the old."
 vulgar_events.8.b: "Go on with the new."
 vulgar_events.9.t: "Our True Faith"
 vulgar_events.9.d: "Through times of difficulty and woe, our church has managed to surpass the heights of the Mexican papacy. The papal authority of Tepeyac has dropped to an all time low, spawning heresies and schisms throughout their holdings. Let us take a moment to celebrate this accomplishment before we continue the holy task of education. Soon, all of those who have been led astray will once again join their rightful flock."
 vulgar_events.9.a: "We are true Christians."
 vulgar_events.10.t: "Language of the Latins"
 vulgar_events.10.d: "One major difference between our church and other Christian denominations is our preservation of the Latin script. In order to better preserve the Bible and ancient catechism, the Tepeyac papacy translated the contents of these documents into Spanish. Through this process, those heretics have corrupted the meaning of the text and altered God’s word. Our latin script follows the true translation, one preserved from a time before the flood. While this provides our church authenticity, it also brings its own share of issues. Many citizens in our nation cannot understand the holy language, and therefore cannot comprehend the exact nature of God’s word. Teaching them the language would be a difficult undertaking, but one which would result in a more holy state."
 vulgar_events.10.a: "All shall learn the old tongue"
 vulgar_events.10.b: "Only the clergy must learn."
 vulgar_events.11.t: "Crushing Reformists"
 vulgar_events.11.d: "The failure of the tepeyac papacy has begun to spill over into our own state. The lack of authority emanating from Mexico City has spawned terrible heresies throughout our continent. Not content to just sully the false pope, these heretics have begun to pour over into our own borders. Our administration has prepared a response against these heretics in coordination with our nation’s clergy. We must stamp out heretic communities and educate those who have been led astray before it is too late!"
 vulgar_events.11.a: "All will kneel."
