 uoc_events.1013.t: "The Great Seer"
 uoc_events.1013.d: "Most quieted down as they gathered around their brave leader’s podium. He tapped his foot sheepishly and then spoke aloud. He spoke of their victories, and also their losses. He spoke of their history and their ancestors. Then, he spoke of Samson. He spoke of Samson’s gift to him, Samson’s special gift. The crowd looked around, befuddled at what he meant. The unread and unwashed masses had never heard of a special gift given by Samson, they could never fully understand their brave leader’s great abilities. He told them of his divine sight, he told them that he saw the spirits of evil surrounding them. At this point, much of the crowd stood in fear, but the ruler slyly curled his fist and told them not to be afraid. He told them that he would protect them, that he would rule over them, that he would never let the spirits come for them. The crowd burst into applause and cheers rang throughout the city’s streets. News of the Great Seer spread like wildfire. Many have begun to devote themselves to this brave man, it might be wise for us to do the same."

 uoc_events.1014.t: "The Orrian Manifesto"
 uoc_events.1014.d: "The council of Orria is one of the most conservative portions of the Traditionalist party. Founded during the “War of The Mad” centuries ago, they gained popularity for their dire calls for Nevada’s independence. Throughout the 15th century, they have steadily gained popularity as a collection of supremely gifted intellectuals. They founded universities throughout the territory of Nevada in order to advance their own freedom focused thought. With the rise of the Despotic movement in the west, many Nevadans have begun to feel threatened by the power hungry dukes of Sunkissed. Some of the most radical members of the Despotic movement have even begun to call for a total abolition of the Constitution in favor of a dictatorship. The first response from this situation came from the Council of Orria, which drafted a short manifesto proclaiming the tenets of the Nevadan Partisan Tradition, giving it the name Anarchism."
