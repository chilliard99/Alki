 above_the_valley_title: "Above the Valley"
 above_the_valley_desc: "Anywhere you look in Anahuac you will find cities that feature a legendary status. The center of the world’s largest faith lies in Mexico City and Veracruz serves as a font for the continent’s wealth. In comparison to the status of these monolithic cities, our capital pales in comparison. We must work towards ensuring that Oaxaca comes to rival these cities and fulfills its role as the center of our growing kingdom."
 language_of_trade_title: "Language of Trade"
 language_of_trade_desc: "For generations the language of governance in the Oaxacan state has been Jarocho. When the valley was united under the Zapotec banner all those years ago the language was chosen due to its common knowledge amongst the learned elite. The Jarocho culture has slowly spread throughout the strata of our state and with our conquest of Veracruz it shows no signs of slowing down. We must consolidate the Jarocho lands and consult the wisdom of our court in order to decide how to proceed given these circumstances."
 consolidate_the_courts_title: "Consolidate the Courts"
 consolidate_the_courts_desc: "The Oaxacan court is an entity unique on the continent of Mexico. In most kingdoms, the ruler is set to do as he wishes in an ivory tower above the common man. Yet in the court of the Oaxacan king, the lords of the realm can personally air their grievances. After expressing their wishes, the sovereign then personally decides on what solution is to be presented or lack of one. So many cowards with crowns pretend to hold true power, but will not look in the eye of those they rule upon. We must ensure that future generations can enjoy this same relationship with their monarch by expanding our court and adding new advisors."
 machine_of_a_state_title: "Machine of a State"
 machine_of_a_state_desc: "Unlike its dysfunctional neighbors, the Oaxacan state is more of a machine than a petty kingdom. The brutal bureaucracy created by the Zapotecs works to ensure that new member states are rightly integrated and kept in check. The courts are quick to deliver justice, the military is expertly tuned for victory, and trade is carried out in the most lucrative manner. There are very few states geared towards perfection like ours, we must use its mechanisms in order to expand."
 heart_of_mexico_title: "Heart of Mexico"
 heart_of_mexico_desc: "As we slowly rise to become the most powerful nation on this continent, we must grow our capital to similarly match this status. Whether we choose to accomplish this by relocating the city or investing in its development, it is paramount that our capital be able to support our grand status. When the Zapotecs first started their conquests from Oaxaca valley, their capital served as the single point of command for their expansion. In the walls of the capital, all foreign rulers were to come and beg the king for their life after their defeat. In the walls of the capital, all merchants came to buy goods from the royal family. In the walls of the capital, the Zapotecs fashioned a kingdom which would flourish into what we rule over today. It would be wise to follow in their footsteps so that our future may be just as bright."
 revolucion_verde_title: "Revolucion Verde"
 revolucion_verde_desc: "There are whispers of a revolution free from bloodshed along the shores of Juchitan. For generations, farmers have practiced a form of crop rotation focused on three different plants. However, with the arrival of new plants from Akilineq and Pablonia, some farmers in Juchitan have begun to experiment with a form of four field crop rotation. Using this innovation, they have quickly spiked agricultural production. If we were to further develop this region’s farmlands, we could diversify other regions allowing for greater production throughout the country."
 vast_beuracracy_title: "Vast Bureaucracy"
 vast_beuracracy_desc: "As our empire grows, the task of governing it has become increasingly difficult. The system set up by our ancestors is experiencing some growing pains in the world it now finds itself in. The benevolent rule of the Zapotecs does not meld with the modern notions of divine right and absolute rule. For this reason we must work to adapt the old traditions to fit with our modern needs. Expanding our bureaucracy is necessary in order to codify our status as a nation rather than a set of traditions. This change will be painful, so it will necessitate a stable society and absolute monarch before its implementation."
 riches_in_the_dark_title: "Riches in the Dark"
 riches_in_the_dark_desc: "One of the Yucatan’s most valuable resources are the elusive dyesticks. These unique plants produce useful hues which are used throughout the continent. During the height of the Maya’s rule, they kept the resource’s production exclusive in order to drive up demand for the product. We must act against our instincts and make sure to slowly sell this valuable resource to ensure the market does not become oversaturated. Expanding our production of the good is the next obvious step in cornering the market."
 fresh_mahogeny_title: "Fresh Mahogeny"
 fresh_mahogeny_desc: "Our conquest of the Yucatan has brought with it the control of a wide breadth of thick jungle. While this may seem like initially useless land, looking closer reveals the value of its various tropical woods. The harder woods could be used to reinforce our own ships while the softer ones could be sold abroad and used in furniture. No doubt some Canadian emperor or rich Buckeye bureaucrat would enjoy having a nice table to plan their American domination, we will make sure all despots have the proper materials for their craft!"
 fortifying_spirits_title: "Fortifying Spirits"
 fortifying_spirits_desc: "The last attempt at a southern campaign came by Emiliano I who dismantled the duke of Tabasco’s realm at great cost. The thick jungle terrain of the south was particularly hard to navigate and ever harder to conquer. The peoples of this region are specially tuned to combat in this unique environment. If we are to attempt any offensives further into the Yucatan, we will need to make sure that our own soldiers have the required experience to survive under such inhospitable terms."
 chiapan_campaign_title: "Chiapan Campaign"
 chiapan_campaign_desc: "Our forefathers attempted to tame the Chiapas to little success. During the war for Tabasco, the duke of the realm called upon a number of different nations in the Yucatan to defend his borders. Among these were the fanatical Zapatistans who mostly stuck to the depths of the jungle. While our ancestors managed to claw away some large portions of their territory, the remaining Zapatistans have been fiercely resistant to our rule. It would do us well to take their most developed territories and let them flee deeper into the jungle."
 the_mayan_capital_title: "The Mayan Capital"
 the_mayan_capital_desc: "The Mayan state is almost as incompetent as the Texan one. For centuries, they managed to dominate the Yucatan and resist foriegn incursions by Cuba. At their height, the Mayans held significant territory in Anahuac and Isthmo. Most of the roadways in our own kingdom are built upon those constructed during their rule of our region. However, as soon as the slightest signs of civil unrest sprouted up in the wake of Colombia’s collapse, the empire shattered into a series of feuding families. While this status is profoundly useful for our intentions in the region, it is disappointing to see such a prolific empire crumble from such minor means."
 quintana_roo_title: "Quintana Roo"
 quintana_roo_desc: "Now that we have decided the fate of the Mayans, our next goal should be to unite their former core territories. The lands of Quintana Roo comprise the eastern half of the Yucatan peninsula and are mostly devoted to carrying goods from the Antilles into Veracruz. Its developed maritime ports are specially constructed to survive the dangerous hurricane season which usually hits the region considerably hard each year. This resilience may prove costly in our attempts at conquest, but the lucrative trade income will hopefully cover the loss."
 bashing_belize_title: "Bashing Belize"
 bashing_belize_desc: "The long Yucatan route holds a deep history as the lifeline of Mexican trade. For centuries, merchants have carried goods from the far Antilles, Hispaniola, Colombia, and even Malaysia along the Yucatan coastline to Veracruz. At the heart of this route, the city of Belize serves as an important rest point for traders to give off their goods to others to finish the journey. Taking this city will allow us to better reign in the flow of goods from both Brazil and the burgeoning colonies of Pablonia and Akilineq."
 unity_in_yucatan_title: "Unity in Yucatan"
 unity_in_yucatan_desc: "Through considerable effort, we have finally managed to tame most of the Yucatan with one remaining territory: Guatemala. The Guatemalan state has had few periods of independence due to its proximity to the dominant Mayans. During the height of the Isthmo republic, the state experienced some independence as a puppet “sister republic” of the east. The region is of particular interest to our state for the presence of some vast cocoa farms. Adding this territory into our own state will finally secure our hegemony over the Yucatan as well as the Cocoa trade."
 ruins_of_the_republic_title: "Ruins of the Republic"
 ruins_of_the_republic_desc: "On a continent full of crusaders, zealous kings, and absolute emperors there seems to be few opportunities for the little guy to give input. However, for a brief period of time, the Isthmo republic attempted to realize democracy. Not the fake democracy of the Californians which only lets nobles participate, true democracy in which every man and woman could vote for their king. The experiment collapsed under the weight of invasion as the Mayan state allied with the Cuban kingdom in order to prevent the revolutionary sentiment from spreading. It is best that we tread carefully when conquering these lands to avoid reigniting that same spark of revolution within the common man."
 lakes_edge_oaxaca_title: "Lake's Edge"
 lakes_edge_oaxaca_desc: "Nicaragua has routinely been a troublemaker in the Catholic world. The Nicatlnhuacs have attempted to wrestle power out of the hands of the bishops in their state for centuries. Their refusal to participate in the crusades alienated them from most allies. The Pope then demanded that the Nicatlnhuacs come to the front, which they flatly refused. Instead, they drafted any man who deserted their company into their own military. This led to the first of many excommunications of the family. Down here in Isthmo, their actions have not had the intended consequences. It is about time they feel the righteous pain of their forefathers sins."
 panamanian_promise_title: "Panamanian Promise"
 panamanian_promise_desc: "The thin border between the Mexican and Colombian continents features nearby Panama city. With our conquest of this area, we will finally unite all of Isthmo and open up the territory of Colombia for our conquest. Panama city was originally founded by Veracruz merchants long before the conversion of the continent as a lone catholic city surrounded by Espiritismo heretics. The city will prove a fine addition to our collection of important sites."
 checking_ranks_title: "Checking Ranks"
 checking_ranks_desc: "It has been a few years since our conquest of the sublime Veracruz, so it has become necessary to reorganize if we are to engage in future conflicts. Throughout the history of the Oaxacan state, our army has served the monarch dutifully in dispatching his enemies. However, in the aftermath of our victory we have allowed the soldiers too long of a break. Many have grown lazy and without discipline. We must hire new talent and promising generals in order to whip our boys back into proper shape."
 the_deathblow_title: "The Deathblow"
 the_deathblow_desc: "The Battle for Veracruz saw a crushing defeat for our former rival of the Huastecans. Their realm had grown significantly throughout the 15th century, coming to rival the power of the crusader states in Africa. Despite this, they were unprepared for the organization of our army and our novel use of Bajio Powder. By planting hundreds of small black powder charges along the walls of Veracruz, we managed to quickly collapse the city’s defenses and slaughter the garrisoned forces. Ever since this defeat, the Huastecans have been a shadow of their former status. It is finally time that we put them out of their misery."
 unity_in_anahuac_title: "Unity in Anahuac"
 unity_in_anahuac_desc: "The next clear step in our nation’s progression is the foundation of an empire. This goal will not come simply as we must first unite the lands of Anahuac. Most troublesome aspect of this task will be taking control of Mexico City and, by extension, the holy sea of Tepeyac. Of course, the Pope has been involved in continental political affairs for centuries, so he will not easily give up his influence. If we do manage to unite these lands we can finally claim our title as the heir to the ancient Guadalupe Empire which repelled the Patriotic hordes and ensured that Catholicism would dominate Mexico."
 march_into_michiocan_title: "March into Michiocan"
 march_into_michiocan_desc: "As the heirs to the Guadalupe empire of antiquity, it is our duty to claim the territories they once held. At its height, the empire stretched from Louisiana to Tabasco and had a hand in almost all continental affairs. Our first avenue for expansion should be into the Bajio, the most faithful region of the continent. Taking over Michoacan and Colima will provide an open avenue for our expansion into the rest of the region."
 pearl_of_the_bahio_title: "Pearl of The Bajio"
 pearl_of_the_bahio_desc: "Guadalajara, the former capital of Jalisco, serves as the most important city of the Bajio. The city’s ancient legacy as the capital of the Bajio empire grants it a historical legitimacy and its role as the center of the Bajio’s trade makes it increasingly important in controlling the region’s commerce. Nearby Guadalajara, the city of Tequila produces one of the region’s most recognizable drinks of the same name. If we are to truly reign in the Bajio, we will need to control this city completely."
 bearing_the_tithe_title: "Bearing the Tithe"
 bearing_the_tithe_desc: "People from the Bajio are among the most zealous in their faith on the continent. This is mostly due to their actions during the famous tithe of Jalisco. When the Patriotic hordes of Africa came rushing down through Empresia and threatened the capital of the Catholic faith, the kings of the Bajio united their realms into a single empire to fight against the incoming force. After a series of very bloody wars, the empire emerged victorious. To this day, the region has yet to recover its population to the older heights. Once we conquer the Bajio we must not forget their sacrifice in the name of Our Lord."
 cocoa_baron_title: "Cocoa Baron"
 cocoa_baron_desc: "Cocoa has long been our state’s most lucrative trade good. While the Cubans had their sugar, the Californians had their wine, and the Canadians had their porcelain we made the finest chocolate. Yet, as our state has grown, the production of cocoa has begun to lag behind. Whether it be due to more lucrative opportunities in our new territories or a decline in demand, many of the old cocoa lords have simply faded into obscurity. In order to ensure that this national icon does not lose its luster, we must work to develop our cocoa resources before it's too late."
 flavored_empire_title: "Flavored Empire"
 flavored_empire_desc: "The advent of large plantations provides us with the opportunity to further improve our cocoa resources. Constructing these large sites will likely be expensive, but will massively increase our ability to produce cocoa and meet international demand. That's right, we’ve gone international. No longer has our chocolate been contained to the Mexican or American continent. All across the world, from Coyemia to Patagonia, people of all different creeds appreciate our expertise."
 the_catholic_frontier_title: "The Catholic Frontier"
 the_catholic_frontier_desc: "Colombia’s conversion to the Catholic faith came during the southern crusades, which were a series of conflicts that occured around the same time as the northern crusades for Texas and Arizonia. The native Colombians were formidable opponents to the arriving crusaders, but were no match for the overwhelming numbers that soon poured into the region. Similar to the north, most of the territory that was conquered became united into one large Colombian empire that expanded over the course of centuries. Of course, the region is now a shadow of its former status. It is up to our empire to restore the once glorious state of this civilization and use it to enrich our own glory."
 colombia_united_title: "Colombia United"
 colombia_united_desc: "Deep within the Colombian capital, a sacred relic stands as the supreme symbol of power in the region. Before the arrival of the Catholic crusaders, the emperor of Bogota ruled over his mountainous realm with an iron fist. Upon his head was an ornate crown encrusted with the finest of emeralds. After his defeat by the invading crusaders, the crown was passed from hand to hand until ending up in the grasp of the new Colombian emperor. From that point forward, the emerald crown served as a powerful symbol of Colombian hegemony and excellence. Once we fully enforce our domination over this region, it would be wise to dawn the crown to show our dedication to their cause."
 huastec_subservience_title: "Huastec Subservience"
 huastec_subservience_desc: "We have done well to unite the Huastecan lands under our rule, but it is important to make sure that they know their place as our inferior. While at one point their military had come to rival ours, they are now under our thumb. Increasing our presence in Poza Rica and crushing any resistance will work well in achieving this aim. Once the Huastecans lose their previous identity and become truly Oaxacan, they can finally join us in glorious prosperity."
 land_of_the_holy_title: "Land of the Holy"
 land_of_the_holy_desc: "Mexico City is the capital of all capitals. Ever since ancient times, the city has been recognized as the center of the Mexican continent. The city served as the capital of the powerful Guadalupe empire during its height and was made the capital of the Bajio empire while it temporarily occupied the area during the crisis of the 4th century. Now it has fallen into our hands and the question of its ownership is raised once again. As the world advances around us, the question should be asked if it is worth clinging to this tradition. Whatever the outcome, we should make sure the city is at least well maintained from its current position."
 wealth_of_the_gulf_title: "Wealth of the Gulf"
 wealth_of_the_gulf_desc: "One of the greatest legacies of the Guadalupe empire was its vast imperial vault filled with artifacts from all corners of the world. The imperial family managed to gather such an impressive collection through the empire’s extensive trade network. In this new age of global commerce, controlling vital areas of trade is sometimes just as valuable as holding an entire region. Before we go forward to conquer the rest of the Guadalupe empire’s former territories, it would be wise if we consolidate our own domestic trade nodes."
 companys_downfall_title: "Company's Downfall"
 companys_downfall_desc: "Even during the time of the Guadalupe empire, the Empresian companies were up to their usual greedy shenanigans. Despite their wealth, they were no match for the rising power from Mexico City. Instead, the company directors of antiquity decided to make trading partners with the empire, selling them the lands of Tamaulipas in exchange for protection against the various tribes of Africa. While the Empresians of today are unlikely to craft such a deal, the lands of Tamaulipas are needed if we are to restore the former extent of the Guadalupe empire."
 antonio_rush_title: "Antonio Rush"
 antonio_rush_desc: "Some of the earliest signs of civilization on the Mexican continent were said to emerge from the Rio Grande. After the great flood and the fall of man, those that survived clung to rivers for their easy access to clean water and irrigation. Small limestone pyramids, similar to the ones in Florida, dot the sides of the Rio Grande. While it is doubtful that these civilizations survived to see the rise of the Guadalupe empire, it will come to pass that their ancestors are citizens of our nation."
 gulf_hegemon_title: "Gulf Hegemon"
 gulf_hegemon_desc: "The final stretch of our continental expansion comes in the territory of Texas. The Alabama strait provides access for most vessels into the Middle seas and has subsequently become an important choke point for all trade flowing into America. During the height of the Guadalupe empire, control of the strait often led to conflicts with the heretical American Empire as it stretched across the continent. In our modern times, with all of the trade flowing in from the new world, control of the strait is as important as ever."
 across_the_channel_oaxaca_title: "Across the Channel"
 across_the_channel_oaxaca_desc: "We now have complete control of the Mexican continent’s trade, yet there still lies one region which eludes our grasp: the Caribbean. Our nation has never prided itself for being a maritime power, but all nations must have some sort of navy in this global age. As other nations rush to claim different parts of the map for their overseas empires, maybe we would do well to take something close to home. Invading into the isle of Cuba would allow us to further tighten our grip on global commerce in addition to growing our expansive empire."
 fruits_of_labor_title: "Fruits of Labor"
 fruits_of_labor_desc: "The isle of Cuba was an Espiritismo nation for centuries before its eventual conversion to the Catholic faith. The process of bringing heathens to the faith was broken down to a science by the various crusader companies of Mexico during their many foreign conquests. However, once the crusades ended, there were very few states where these missionaries could make use of their talents. This all changed when the king of Cuba converted and subsidized the arrival of these missionaries. In less than a century, the island converted from a staunchly heretical stock to the Lord’s grace."
 catholic_caribbean_title: "Catholic Caribbean"
 catholic_caribbean_desc: "The most valuable plunder we have obtained from our conquest of Cuba has been the myriad of different sugar plantations. Ever since the first farms were constructed, the powerful sugar barons have controlled aspects of the Cuban state. The constant battle between the baron and ruling class of the Cuban state is a tale as old as time, yet we have experienced no difficulties from their resistance. Our own empire has grown to such an extent that no man is rich enough to stop the will of our emperor."
 viva_mexico_title: "Viva Mexico"
 viva_mexico_desc: "Through the ages, no nation has claimed the title of supreme emperor of Mexico. Any monarch who claimed this title would have to be so powerful as to nearly control an entire continent. Yet here we stand, the most powerful empire to ever exist since the fall of man. If there was any nation which could claim this most magnanimous of titles: it would be ours."
 house_of_cards_title: "House of Cards"
 house_of_cards_desc: "There is a change in breeze among the nations of the Catholic world. It can be felt in the chapels and statehouses. The Pope’s power is on the decline and the great Empire of Texas is beginning to breathe its final breaths. A great period of change is coming and it is our job to succeed in those times. As it stands we must act carefully around this delicate house of cards to not too heavily disturb the balance of power as we grow our nation."
 la_edad_del_oro_title: "La Edad del Oro"
 la_edad_del_oro_desc: "Our nation’s success is not surprising as it was foretold by the heavens above. Phillip Mixteca, the original founder of the Zapotecs, was told by a mystic that his sons would come to rule the lands of Mexico. For the rest of his life, every time the king slept he would dream of red flowers blooming out of every corner of the land. The people of Mexico would frolic about the countryside, grabbing the flowers and dancing hand in hand. This dream of unity which Phillip dreamt must to pass, the only question is by whose sword will it be made real?"
 global_hegemon_oaxaca_title: "Global Hegemon"
 global_hegemon_oaxaca_desc: "Through conquest and grit we have managed to create one of the most powerful empires throughout history. There are very few nations which can claim to have reached our height, one of which being the Guadalupe empire of antiquity. Not even Peter’s grand Maple Throne of Canada dominates on the world stage as we do now. We stand without parallel in our time, the history books will be sure to note our ascendancy."

 oaxacan_events.2.d: "We have received a surprising letter from His Eminence the Pope of Tepeyac. In an attempt to preserve his waning religious power, the Pope has offered us his territory on this earthly plane in exchange for a protected status in our state. This is a profoundly useful development for interests in Anahuac, yet it still carries a strange feeling nonetheless. It is likely this move will heighten fears of schism throughout the continent as it signals a clear decrease in papal authority. Why His Eminence would willingly invite this turmoil into the Catholic world eludes reason. Despite all of this, the offer is something we cannot refuse. The opportunity to take the most prolific city on the continent without bloodshed has fallen right into our laps. Coupled with the fact that it will eliminate any chance we come into an unfashionable war with the Pope himself and this offer becomes essential if we are to expand past our current status. Our only option must be to accept his blessing."

 oaxacan_events.3.t: "Huastec Dominiation"
 oaxacan_events.3.d: "For the better part of a century, the Huastecans served as our greatest rival on the continent. This has led to generations of their stock being raised with the notion that our state is bloodthirsty and treacherous. Unsurprisingly, this ingrained aversion has led the Huastecans to be resistant to our rule. As their numbers grow in our kingdom, it becomes important to slowly push them towards the Oaxacan way of life. Yet many of our own advisors have wondered if there is a different path. Instead of assimilating the Huastecans like we would any other group, we could work towards othering them in our society. Forcing them to work for their own liberation and suppressing Huastec symbols could act as penance for their forefather’s sins. While this would likely cause much greater dissent from their population, it would also make their former territories more easily pliable by our bureaucrats. Whatever the choice, we must choose an action which works to inspire the most prosperity for our kingdom."

 oaxacan_events.5.d: "In a time long before the Zapotec’s dominance of our fair valley and even before the crusades which converted this continent, the great Mayan state dominated most of central Mexico. From Managua to Veracruz, Gran Maya exerted its influence across the better part of the continent. Their influence can be seen in our roadways, which are built upon the ancient ones they first crafted, and our faith, as the Mayans were tolerant of the Catholics and allowed missionaries to spread their religion across Anahuac and the Yucatan. Yet today we are given the chance to dictate the future of the Mayans through our own actions. With our conquest of Campeche we have gained control of the capital of the Mayan empire and, by extension, given ourselves the opportunity to continue their legacy. The choice to claim our title as Emperor of all Mayas is more difficult than it appears, as by claiming the legacy we legitimize their independence. The matter of titles is always difficult, let us choose an option that works best for our needs."

For centuries, the lake has been a communally shared asset of the Nicaraguan kingdom which allows every citizen to make use of its water. Despite this free use, the lake has mostly resisted all signs of decay. With our arrival into the region, it becomes important for us to manage how this icon is maintained. While the lake was always open to the people of the region, it was heavily protected by the Nicatlnhuacs during their rule. For our interests in the region, should we allow the local lords of the region to ensure the lake's protection or employ the service of our own bureaucrats? The former would no doubt please the local population, but the latter could allow us to make use of the lake ourselves. Alternatively, we could simply pillage the lake of its resources and use its riches for ourselves. While this would be the most contentious option, it would greatly enrich our own coffers."

As the most important figure in Christendom, the Pope commands quite a bit of influence over our people’s actions. Once Mexico City was added to our empire’s collection, many flocked to the city in order to make it their new home. These factors, coupled with the city’s ancient legitimacy, have led to it overshadowing our own capital. We must ensure that our nation has a strong central point of command for its further growth. Either we can choose to move the capital to the historic Mexico City or keep it where it is. We could even go further as to move the Holy Sea to our own capital in order to ensure that it becomes the focus of the Catholic world.

Traditionally, the king sat just above the nobles in order to differentiate him from the common lord, yet not too high that the average man would not need to strain in order to speak with him. Some of the architects believe that the throne should be placed lower, as to be among the people of the state. Others believe that our throne should be far above the rest of the court to the point of inconvenience. While a decision like this would usually be relegated to one of our many servants, this affair has quickly become a public matter.

Through the generations, this identity has become a catch all term for the various blended cultures of the region. Yet despite this history, most academics struggle to differentiate the Oaxacan identity from that of the Jarochos. Through years of melding, the two different groups have become nearly identical. The discourse on cultures has now become a bitterly divided affair, with one vocal group calling for the total abolition of the title of Oaxacan in favor of calling them Jarochos. The others state that the Jarocho identity has become melded into the larger Oaxacan culture through trade and conquest. Our own administration has even begun to join in on the arguments. If we do not act quickly, this discourse will consume aspects of the state and promote inefficiency. We must pick a side, before it's too late."
 oaxacan_events.9.a: "Nonesense, it is Oaxacan!"
 oaxacan_events.9.b: "I mean it is Jarocho... right?"

 oaxacan_events.10.t: "Codifying Culture"
 oaxacan_events.10.d: "The idea of a national identity is a recent invention but a profoundly useful one. For centuries our state has attempted to fashion itself not as a nation of Chilangos or Costeno, but as one unified Oaxacan. Choosing to spread our own Oaxacan ideals throughout our empire will be a difficult task, but will undoubtedly prove incredibly useful for our own internal cohesion. Across the countryside, we will scatter bureaucrats to install the Oaxacan spirit in every citizen of the state. From town to town, our men will ensure that the Oaxacan identity is promoted by every mayor and governor. When it is all over, we will be an empire of single mind and single goal. For generations to come, the Oaxacan spirit will live on. Yet, what about the identities lost? As an empire, a part of our strength comes from the diversity of our talent. So many different people with so many skill sets would be made homogenous for the sake of our hegemony. Is that truly worth it? If we are to go forward with codifying the Oaxacan identity and promoting its spread, we must make sure the outcome will promote the most prosperity."
 oaxacan_events.10.a: "Yes, let our culture dominate!"
 oaxacan_events.10.b: "This is improper."
 oaxacan_events.11.t: "Codification Sucess"
 oaxacan_events.11.d: "We have successfully converted some portions of our empire to the codified Oaxacan culture. This great success will only accelerate the spread of our culture to other corners of the globe. Through our unity, we get our strength!"
 oaxacan_events.11.a: "As intended."
 oaxacan_events.12.t: "Colombian Independence"
 oaxacan_events.12.d: "Our conquest of the Colombian region has left us with many new avenues for expansion, but lacking the necessary legacy to claim the continent. Yes, our emperor has dawned the emerald crown and ventured to the city of Bogota, yet it still stands that we are not the Colombian empire of old. If we were to revive the old empire, give the heirs to the Colombian throne control of the region, we could use them as a puppet to conquer the rest of the continent under our state. We are beginning to feel the pains that come from an empire as large as ours, maybe it would be wise to let the Colombians manage themselves under supervision. We would make sure that they stay loyal to our cause and protect our interests, what is the most harm that it could cause?"
 oaxacan_events.12.a: "No, it is our land!"
