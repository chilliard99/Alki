 the_floridian_identity:0 "The Floridian Identity"
 the_floridian_identity_desc:0 "The southern part of the Floridian isles hold heavy differences when compared to the north. The people of the south have traditionally been more aligned with the Setonese and Cuban peoples. Upon the arrival of the Kyushans during the 11th century, the south’s connection to their eastward neighbors saw them assist in the conquest of their northern brethren. For centuries after, the Northern Floridians have seen the south as traitors and enemies. In kind, the Southern Floridians have routinely attempted to damage the prosperity of the north through conflict and sabotage."
 a_mesh_of_peoples:0 "Ancient University Culture"
 a_mesh_of_peoples_desc:0 "South Florida’s spirit of innovation revived alongside the end of the slave trade in the 15th century. During the height of the Kyushu empire, many academic nobles were sold into the slave trade for use in foriegn empires. The influence of Floridian thought can be seen most prominently in Maritime province shipping technology. Ironically, many of the innovations which were created by indentured Floridians helped to perpetuate the grueling colonization of Greenland. The universities at Calusa and Miami have quickly become centers of modern thought."
 the_cubano_link:0 "The Cubano Link"
 the_cubano_link_desc:0 "The South’s relation with the kingdom of Cuba has been frequently tested throughout their history. For long periods of time, the Cubans held the city of Miami and most of Southern Florida as integral parts of their territory. On the other hand, the Kingdom of Cuba played a key role in freeing Florida from the hands of the Kyushans by demanding their release and supplying the new state with a small navy. The presence of Cuban influence on Southern Florida has worked its way into the south’s people, with many local dukes tracing their lineage back to famous Cuban dynasties."
 kyushu_colony:0 "Old Hana"
 kyushu_colony_desc:0 "Among the dukes of Southern Florida, the ruler of Hana is unique for his close connection to the old Kyushu empire. St.Lucie was the capital of Setonese Florida and still manages most of the trade routes between the Reiwans and Caribbeans. One of the most striking aspects of the city are the many abandoned palaces which were once full of nobles from across the seas. Now all that remains are the descendants of those loyal to the Floridian cause."
 calusa_kingdom:0 "Kingdom of Calusa"
 calusa_kingdom_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Calsua quickly became a prominent force in the south after the collapse of Kyushu rule. The name of the state comes from the mythical “Calusans” who, according to Zahran legend, fought against the heretics of the north and carved the Caloosahatchee river. Through securing an alliance with Diego de Los Claros, the architect of Floridian independence, they were granted a sizable chunk of the west coast. Throughout the following centuries the state continued to expand into Tampa, Naples, and even as far as Canaveral before the Magical Revolts of the 14th century."
 the_three_ducal_break:0 "The Magical Revolts"
 the_three_ducal_break_desc:0 "By the dawn of the 14th century, much of Southern Florida was dominated by the Calusa and the state was attempting to fully unite the isles with a campaign into Cairo. This dream of unity was quickly shattered as the duke of Orlando marched the fourth army south in the middle of the offensive. Soon his men arrived at the city of Calusa and took the royal family hostage, declaring the independence of Orlando, Tampa, and Canaveral. Many blame the secretive Order of the Magic Kingdom for causing this abrupt betrayal, hence why these actions were named the Magical Revolts."
 dolphin_warriors:0 "Enduring Character"
 dolphin_warriors_desc:0 "Southern Florida’s environment is brutish for the average citizen. Constant hurricanes, mosquito hoards, and draining summers make those that inhabit the region especially resistant. This resilience is seen clearly in their soldiers, who are frequently hired out by kings throughout America and Mexico. During the height of the Floridian slave trade, the “Dolphin Warriors” of the region were highly valued in wars throughout the Great Lakes. The most prominent of these slave soldiers was Cleto Okamoto who led the Army of Withlacoochee deep into Antebella during Fredrick’s War."

 the_bountiful_nile:0 "The Bountiful Nile"
 the_bountiful_nile_desc:0 "The Nile, which runs from Okechobee to the Alabaman Sea, is the most prominent aspect of life within North Florida. Its banks provide easy irrigation of crops which contributes to their ability to sustain large populations. The Nile's calm waters make travel easy and allows for the quick transport of goods throughout the island. Within traditional Zahran mythology, the Nile’s steady flow is divinely dictated by the high god Amun."
 ancient_city_of_cairo:0 "Ancient Cairo"
 ancient_city_of_cairo_desc:0 "The city of Cairo is among the oldest cities on the American continent, predating those of New York, Tokyo, and even Ottawa. A modern observer can see stoneworks which trace back generations and colossal murals which adorn the city’s mostly ornamental walls. This ancient legacy does come with drawbacks as modern irrigation and fortifications seen in newer cities are lacking. Despite this the city has remained unconquered for nearly three hundred years and is a thriving center of Floridian Civilization."
 old_kingdom_of_cairo:0 "Old Kingdom of Cairo"
 old_kingdom_of_cairo_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Cairo, similar to the city, has become the most persistent part of North Floridian politics. The original Old Kingdom was established back during the 3rd century, as the king of the city expanded south along the river. Throughout the ages the Kingdom has stood as the sole force of unity in the north, with varying levels of control. During the Kyushu occupation of Florida, it was the former nobles of Cairo who led the resistance movement by striking deals with the Madisonites and Cubans. In modern times the kingdom has managed to unite the Northern Nile and holds a strong grasp on the flow of trade throughout Florida."
 knights_of_alexandria:0 "The Cajun Crusade"
 knights_of_alexandria_desc:0 "The “Cajun Crusade” for Alexandria was one of many Catholic crusades throughout the middle ages. When the Catholic crusaders originally conquered eastward into Louisiana, the Floridians had supported the few local Zahran lords in defending Biloxi. This, along with their apparent “heretic” nature, made Florida the perfect target for further conquest. The Mexican crusaders quickly overwhelmed Alexandria, and were making advances towards Cairo when a coalition of Ainu, Calusan, and Shoguns soldiers forced a retreat at the battle of Valdosta. The Mexican armies mostly dissolved after this point as the Italian crusade began kicking into order which caused the Ainu to pull back most of their support."
 taking_back_alexandria:0 "Alexandrian Order"
 taking_back_alexandria_desc:0 "In the midst of the Cajun Crusade, a collection of wealthy Nilean knights founded the Alexandrian Order. After Ainu and Kyushan support for continued fighting in Florida collapsed, the Order planned and executed a counter attack into Louisiana. The order landed at Biloxi, and managed to push as far as Natchez before being devastated by a hurricane and surprise attack. The order still continues to hold power in Western Florida as their founder, Omar Saleh, eyes up the strait once again."
 the_mihr_hajj:0 "Egyptian Pyramids"
 the_mihr_hajj_desc:0 "The pyramids at Zagazig were constructed in an ancient time unremembered. The traditional story told within the Zahran faith is that the site was created by the Egyptians, a people in exile from their home in the far east. The Egyptians believed that if they were to make these monuments to Amun, they might walk across the seas and return home. Upon placing the final cap on the central pyramid, it is said that the seas split and the Egyptians were allowed to walk home. Those that stayed behind, to make sure the pyramids would not be damaged and the sea would not drown their brethren, are said to be the ancestors of the Nilean people."
 the_floridian_diasporans:0 "Floridian Diaspora"
 the_floridian_diasporans_desc:0 "Slavery in the Great Lakes has a long history, but was never as particularly brutal as it was during the late middle ages with the Floridian Slave Trade. The Kyushu conquest of Florida brought many problems to the empire, so instead of constantly suppressing revolution the Kyushans opted to jail and indenture those who resisted their rule. Floridian slavery exploded in the 13th and 14th centuries as the Kyushans began selling non criminals from their remaining colonial territories. The most brutal conditions during this time came from Canada, where most Floridians were shipped off to Greenland in an attempt to colonize the frigid island. After the abolition of slavery in Canada under the proclimation of 1409, the slave trade slowed and Floridians coalesed into small communities throughout the Great Lakes."

 the_royal_koi_fleet_desc:0 "Koi fish were specially bred for color and seen as a symbol of royal status on the island of Kyushu. During the imperial period the Koi represented the island itself and even featured on the naval flags. The Koi Fleet was established during the height of the empire and became a feared force on the seas. Sailors from throughout the empire and beyond were specially selected to pilot the elegant vessels."
 colonial_furorida:0 "Colonial Florida"
 colonial_furorida_desc:0 "In the 11th century, the great emperor of Kyushu set his sights on overseas expansion. The vast system of daimyos controlled by the shogun at Tokyo made a northern push nearly impossible, so he opted to go West into Florida. The conquest of Florida was swift and devastating. Maintaining such a large island far from the capital required brutal methods, most prominent of which was the Floridian Slave Trade."
 the_kyushu_system:0 "Kyushan Congress"
 the_kyushu_system_desc:0 "After the loss of Florida in the 13th century, a massive peasant revolt in Miyazaki caused the imperial period to come to an end. The new Kyushu Kingdom had a popular congress, whose body was made up of average citizens. While this legislature held little power, four different dukes from the provinces of Miyazaki, Kagoshima, West Fukuoka, and East Fukuoka were given the ability to check the actions of the emperor. The resulting state was indecisive and rampant with corruption."
 caribbean_intervention:0 "Caribbean Intervention"
 caribbean_intervention_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Cuba and the Empire of Kyushu often played a cat-and-mouse game for domination of the Bahamas. During the initial expansion of the Kyushans into Florida, the islands of Grand Bahama and Great Abaco were taken as part of a deal splitting up the bahamas. In the wake of the empire’s collapse the Cubans have continued to expand closer into the Kyushan territory, being met with fierce resistance."
 kyushan_tea:0 "Kyushan Tea"
 kyushan_tea_desc:0 "Out of all of the trades practiced on the isle of Kyushu, none are more sacred than that of tea growth. During the imperial period, green tea was shipped as far as Utah due to the growing taste for sweet tea among American nobles. With the collapse of the empire, the price of tea skyrocketed and many throughout America began scrambling to obtain their own source of the drink. To this day the remaining estates have become increasingly valuable."
 naval_academy_at_fukuoka:0 "Naval Academy at Fukuoka"
 naval_academy_at_fukuoka_desc:0 "The Naval Academy at Fukuoka was created during the imperial period and focused on the training of sailors for the koi fleet. The rigorous training these sailors underwent made it a costly venture, mostly funded by wealthy pottery barons and estate lords. As the university expanded, foreign nobles began training alongside sailors and spread their talents back home. Despite the collapse of the Kyushan empire, the university still continues its education in maritime studies."
 the_empire_collapses:0 "The Empire Collapses"
 the_empire_collapses_desc:0 "The collapse of Kyushan unity came slowly over the course of a century. It all started during the early 13th century when the Kyushans came to the defense of their Ainu allies against the Canadians. The Battle of Fortune Bay destroyed a large portion of the imperial navy. Three months later, while the fleet was still in repair, Diego de Los Claros led a massive Floridian revolt from the city of Cairo. The Cubans quickly ensured the independence of his state, and without a solid navy the Kyushans could do nothing but watch their Floridian holdings crumble. At home, a massive peasant revolt at Miyazaki devastated the imperial capital and forced the emperor to sign a treaty splitting up his power. Over the resulting centuries, the island has slowly drifted apart, with an official split in the early 15th century."

 daimyo_of_hiroshima:0 "Eternal Hiroshima"
 daimyo_of_hiroshima_desc:0 "Ever since the times of the Reiwa dynasty, the city of Hiroshima and its ruler has been a powerful entity. In the 12th century the Daimyo of Hiroshima led the revolt against the Shogun, freeing the majority of the Chugokan people. Ever since this action, the region has looked up to the duke for guidance. Under the guise of ancient legitimacy the duke of Hiroshima claimed the title “Protector of the Seto” during the 14th century, and ever since has sought to thwart the Shogun’s expansion."
 kyushuan_containment:0 "Kyushan Containment"
 kyushuan_containment_desc:0 "After the Kyushan conquest of Florida and collapse of the western Daimyos, several invasions into Chogoku and Shikoku were attempted throughout the 12th century. The obvious military advantage held by the Kyushans prompted the construction of hundreds of castles along the coasts of the Seto Sea. These castles still stand today, mostly abandoned, years after their relevance had concluded."
 the_pirates_of_awaji:0 "Pirates of Awaji"
 the_pirates_of_awaji_desc:0 "The isle of Awaji is mainly known for rampant piracy. After breaking free from the Shikoku duke during the early 15th century due to disputes over incense taxes, many on the island were unable to sustain themselves. Nearly a decade after independence, the island had devolved into a pirate den, with buccaneers coming from as far as Nova Scotia to make quick cash. Wealthy pirates were quick to bribe dukes in Shikoku and the Bahamas in order to maintain their raiding routes. Soon the age of freedom on the open seas became a bureaucratic and structured mess."
 holy_itsukushima:0 "Holy Itsukushima"
 holy_itsukushima_desc:0 "The shrine of Itsukushima is one of the prominent sites within the Shinto religion for its ancient legacy. Since a time before the Reiwa, the Disciples of Amaterasu have protected and maintained the monument. Through war, peace, and thousands of years the shrine has stood tall. The disciples who have devoted themselves to protecting the monument are bound by a strict code which prevents even the most prestigious of emperors from approaching without permission."
 antebellum_ambitions:0 "Seto United"
 antebellum_ambitions_desc:0 "The promise of a united Setonese state emerged immediately after the fall of the western daimyos. The dukes of Hiroshima and Shikoku both met at Himeji and drafted the proper accords. For one year, the great kingdom of Seto embarked on a campaign of conquest into Kyoto and the rest of the daimyos before a coalition of Kyushans and Ainu collapsed their state. Ever since, the region has been shattered among what remains."
 the_tsushiman_wars:0 "Early Adopters"
 the_tsushiman_wars_desc:0 "Unique among their neighbors in the Japanese isles, the states of the Setonese sea were quick to adopt much of the naval technologies coming out of Mexico in the 15th century. Particularly the gimbaled compasses of Empresia and coches of the Yucatan were transferred by pirates in the Caribbean to those on Awaji. This transfer of technologies resulted in a more sophisticated fleet for the Setonese which could navigate deep waters and protect against harsh weather."
 united_shikoku:0 "The Beef Trade"
 united_shikoku_desc:0 "Among the different goods traded on the Seto sea, none is more sought after than the beef of Chugokan. The complex process of raising the prized cattle is an ancient tradition and practiced mainly within the Kobe province. More complicated than the raising of the cattle was the expensive process of transportation, which was done using a specially designed vessel: The Shimane Maru. The Shimane Maru featured a special “Kobe hold” which was lined with tightly woven sisal cloth. Sailors would soak the cloth with water which would cool down the hold and preserve the beef. From the hold of the Shimane Maru, Kobe beef would make its way from Kansai to the plates of Canadian emperors and Italian kings alike."

 shogun_and_diaymos:0 "Shogun of Tokyo"
 shogun_and_diaymos_desc:0 "The history of the Nippon region has been heavily centralized around Tokyo. The original Reiwa dynasty which united the Japanese Isles ruled from the city of Tokyo. The Shogun who succeeded this empire was based in Tokyo. In the modern age, the center of Japan’s development lies within Tokyo. Despite all of this, the Shogun’s power has faltered as daimyos have slinked away over the centuries. The remaining small cities which surround the once great civilization pale in comparison to the Archipelago spanning network of the past."
 the_spring_accords:0 "Explorative Ambitions"
 the_spring_accords_desc:0 "At the dawn of the 15th century, a new persistent idea began perforating throughout Tokyo academia: A Route to California. The far off lands of California were not only resource rich, but heavily invested in the porcelain and tea of the Japanese Isles. Many theorized that by venturing east into the Atlantic, Japanese sailors could avoid the heavy tariffs of the Middle Seas."
 high_nipponian_culture:0 "High Nipponian Culture"
 high_nipponian_culture_desc:0 "Most modern Japanese rulers can trace their lineage back to the Reiwa dynasty of the 3rd century. This great empire united the disparate isles and consolidated the image of Japan into a one long archipelago. The penchant for excellence and grace which so heavily enriched the old empire’s courts still lingers in the practices of Zahran and Shinto alike. Tokyo and the Southern Cities’ role as the center of this culture grants them centuries of legitimacy unseen in those of Florida, Hokkaido, or Kyushu."
 the_ainu_hokkaidan_wars:0 "The Spring Accords"
 the_ainu_hokkaidan_wars_desc:0 "The total collapse of the shogunate system came slowly over the course of centuries, but first began with the loss of Hokkaido and Tohoku with the Spring Accords. In the middle of the 9th century, the Ainu King Kamuy proposed a peaceful break from the Shogun in exchange for a guarantee that “No Ainu soldier would march upon the city of Tokyo.” This deal has remained intact throughout the centuries, with the Ainu going as far as hiring foreign soldiers during wars against the shogun."
 betrayl_in_the_north:0 "Gold Squatters"
 betrayl_in_the_north_desc:0 "Trade along the eastern coast of Japan was heavily regulated by the Shogun, with few families being granted independent charters throughout the centuries. These families were sometimes referred to as “Gold Squatters” for their very restrictive use of their newfound wealth. In modern times, the Shogun continues to attempt wrangling control, but mostly fails due to an ineffective court and daimyo trade independence."
 canadian_competition:0 "The Old Court"
 canadian_competition_desc:0 "Court life in the modern shogunate has mostly collapsed. The old court’s festivals were grand gatherings of all the daimyos into Tokyo for a week of discussion and planning, but now only a handful of representatives show up. The Southern Cities are far too independent and the Shogun too complacent to attempt any change. The court of the past was lavish, with gold and copper adorned goblets clinking long into the night. Now the taps have run dry and the halls of the capital are filled with common rabble. All the while, the Daimyos slowly distance themselves from the city where they once were whole."
 puerto_rican_purchase:0 "The Reiwa System"
 puerto_rican_purchase_desc:0 "In a time far in the past, the great Reiwa dynasty held colonies along the east coast in Nova Scotia and Antebella. These colonies employed a governor who regulated the aspects of the state with a high level of autonomy. Governors could wage war, raise taxes, and fund lavish constructions all without Shogun approval. Instead, loyalty was ensured through economic dependence. The mainland would exclusively trade with the colony and heavily tax any foreign goods. Any modern attempts at colonization would no doubt follow this same structure."

 old_tokaido_desc:0 "Along the coast from Nagoya to Tokyo, the great road of Tokaido ran for miles. The road was originally constructed under the Reiwa dynasty, but came to be defined by areas outside of its influence. The modern Tokaido culture comes from those who ventured inland from the road, into Gifu and Nagano. This frontier provided freedom and opportunity for the poor, rich, and criminal citizens who couldn’t stand the rigid structure of the Reiwa state. Soon the old road crumbled, but its legacy continued among the men of the wilds."
 the_northern_cities:0 "The Northern Cities"
 the_northern_cities_desc:0 "As opposed to the Southern Cities, the Northern Cities include the towns of Nakatsugawa, Kyoto, and Ishikawa who broke away from the Shogun following the invasion of the Setonese. Since the split, these cities have been forced to fight for their independence against the overbearing Ainu and eager Setonese. Pragmatic diplomacy has defined the region, with royal marriages and civil mergers being commonplace."
 the_gate_to_ishikawa:0 "Innovation of Ishikawa"
 the_gate_to_ishikawa_desc:0 "The university of Ishikawa was the center of advancement in the Japanese isles. While the universities of Florida fell into obscurity with the Kyushan conquests, the Ishikawans were defining early concepts of inertia and investigating Californian alchemies. The university’s scholars even devised weapons of war when the Ainu began invading their lands using the black powder of Bajio on the tips of arrows."
 ainu_capitalization:0 "Ainu Defense"
 ainu_capitalization_desc:0 "In the modern age, the most pressing threat to Nippon independence is not the empire of Kyushu, Setonese dukes, or Shogun, but the declining Ainu Kingdom. Ever since the Battle of Fortune Bay and the devastation of the Ainu fleet, the Kingdom has increasingly turned its eyes south to challenge the states of Honshu. This began with the conquest of Tohoku, but now lingers in the Ainu attempt to take Ishikawa. Without the protection of the shogun, the fate of Northern Nippon looks grimmer by the day."
 ancient_ties:0 "Yoshimasa Devotion"
 ancient_ties_desc:0 "Outside of the southern cities, there is a particularly cult-like reverence for Reiwa Yoshimasa, the founding member of the Reiwa dynasty. Great murals of Yoshimasa’s deeds adorn the walls of Nakatsugawa and small idols feature in nearly every dwelling. The prevalence of this praise originates from a local belief that the dynasty originated from Nakatsugwa and only later moved to Tokyo."
 antebellum_traders:0 "Tidewater Traders"
 antebellum_traders_desc:0 "Despite Japan’s proximity to mainland America, the isles typically do not get involved with continental affairs. The key exception to this is the lucrative Tidewater trade, which runs between the coasts of Antebella and Japan. The exchange of goods, ideas, and religions along this route has become a central focus in recent centuries. By the 15th century, the majority of trade conducted along the Tidewater shores is by private ventures due to the lack of political unity on either side of the sea."
 origin_of_the_sammuri:0 "Origin of the Sammuri"
 origin_of_the_sammuri_desc:0 "The origins of the Samurai can be traced back to the lands of Tokaido during the height of the Shogunate. Legend says that the lands of the frontier were plagued with thieves and marauders, so merchants who traveled the region would need private protection. This rise in crime coincided with the end of a bloody civil war, which left many experienced soldiers without work. These new Samurai made their living as hired soldiers in the north. Now dozens of Samurai clans operate throughout the isles as hired armies."

 the_wartorn_dutchies:0 "The Trampled Upon"
 the_wartorn_dutchies_desc:0 "Unlike most other regions of Japan, Tohoku has never been united under a single rule. Throughout its history, the people of Tohoku have been under the thumb of Ainu, Hokkaidans, the Shogun, and Reiwa without having their own representation. At the dawn of the 15th century this continues to ring true as the region is once again dominated by the Ainu Kingdom."
 tale_of_two_cities:0 "The Twin Cities"
 tale_of_two_cities_desc:0 "The twin cities of Sendai and Niigata have played a pivotal role in the history of Tohoku. Traditionally the city of Sendai was the northern capital of the Shogunate, and the city of Niigata was famous for being a lucrative maritime port. The high court culture of these societies bled into the surrounding areas, defining the Tohoku region. Any attempt at unity within Tohoku would need to wrestle control of both cities."
 hokkaidan_migration:0 "Hokkaidan Migration"
 hokkaidan_migration_desc:0 "When the Ainu Kingdom signed the Spring Accords which formalized its split from the Shogunate, those that wished to remain as daimyos were predominantly Hokkaidan. In an attempt to prevent insurrection, the Ainu exiled most of the Hokkaidan loyalists across the strait into Tohoku. By the 15th century, the majority of Northern Tohoku is filled with Hokkaidan influence and is beginning to creep south."
 ainu_subjugation:0 "Betrayl Amongst Brothers"
 ainu_subjugation_desc:0 "While the region of Tohoku once had greater ambitions of unity, this has mostly subsided with the rise of distrust amongst the competing families of Niigata and Sendai. When the Ainu first invaded south into Tohoku, the families of Niigata warmly accepted the new state as a means to advance their status. The Sendai bitterly resisted, but lost most of their territory to the Ainu state. The distrust which has formed over this difference has split the region into a bitter east and west."
 isle_of_sado:0 "Isle of Sado"
 isle_of_sado_desc:0 "One of the reasons the city of Niigata grew to its current state was its proximity to the isle of Sado. Sado’s wealthy gold mines have been the subject of excavation ever since the Reiwa dynasty. The city of Niigata grew as a mainland port to unload and distribute the gold off the island. Soon other goods began to be traded and exported from the city, resulting in Niigata becoming the dominent trading port on Tohoku. By the 15th century, the isle of Sado remains the primary goldworks for the Ainu kingdom and a pivotal part of the state."
 the_forgotten_isle:0 "The Forgotten Isle"
 the_forgotten_isle_desc:0 "There is a legend amongst the fishermen on the east coast of Tohoku that there was once a great isle in the east. This isle held a civilization that wielded weapons of fire and ships of steel. Any sailor who approached the isle would be met with heavy storms and forced to turn away. These people would harass those on the coast with lightning and great floods until Ebisu, god of fisherman, sank the isle beneath the waves. To this day, the former waters of the isle are avoided at all costs by those who venture east."
 the_niigatan_order:0 "The Old Toad Society"
 the_niigatan_order_desc:0 "Despite its vast wealth and excess, the city of Niigata holds a darker underbelly. The Old Toad Society originated from smugglers who would bring mainland American criminals to Japan in order to escape the law. It quickly grew into a vast network of illegal businesses which operated outside of the Shogun’s eye. When the area broke from the Shogun’s grasp, the society became the dominant force within the region. Even to this day, while the Ainu hold control over the province of Niigata, The Old Toad Society really holds the reins."

 the_frigid_island_desc:0 "Throughout the east coast, there is no wine more renowned than that of the Ainu variety. Though the wines of California and New York may be deeper aged and more complex, the Ainu wine is sought after for its rarity. The vineyards of Ikeda, which grow most of Japan’s grapes, are fiercely guarded by the Ainu and only occasionally opened to export their crafts to the wider world. Even the Shogun’s many requests were denied during his reign of the isle. The strict trading of this wine places the Ainu in a unique position within the gulf’s network."
 the_greenland_colony:0 "Greenland Fervor"
 the_greenland_colony_desc:0 "While the majority of colonization was completed by the Canadians, the initial settlements on Greenland were constructed by the Ainu. The Ainu required all Floridian slaves, most of whom worked as indentured servants on trading vessels, to be placed towards the colonization of Nuuk. This was not unusual for the state, as it had used similar techniques in claiming the islands of Urup and Iturup. The small success that the colony found allowed the Ainu to further tighten their grip on the Saint Lawrence Gulf’s many trade routes."
 greater_ainu_empire:0 "Gold on the Waves"
 greater_ainu_empire_desc:0 "The golden age of the Ainu state was a nearly three century long period in which the kingdom dominated trade within the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. After breaking free from the Shogun’s grasp in the Spring Accords, the Ainu King embarked on a campaign of northern conquest into Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. At its height the kingdom stretched from Augusta to Aomori before collapsing under the new Lafayette dynasty."
 wealth_of_the_gulf:0 "Wealth of the Gulf"
 wealth_of_the_gulf_desc:0 "Domination over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence has been the primary goal of the Ainu for centuries. It began under their expansion into the north, where they took key ports in an attempt to regulate traders. It continued with the establishment of the largest domestic trading fleet, which shipped goods from the Hudson Bay region into Tidewater, Grand Lawrence, and the Shogun’s own doorstep. It fell apart with the multiple repeated losses to the Lafayette dynasty and destruction of the navy. Even into the 15th century, the Ainu king still looks north with wanting eyes."
 war_for_st_lawrence:0 "War for St.Lawrence"
 war_for_st_lawrence_desc:0 "The collapse of Ainu control in the north came with the Battle of Fortune Bay. The new upstart Canadian emperor, Pierre Lafayette, gave the Ainu emperor a proposition: split the bay. The Canadians would get Nova Scotia and Maine and the Ainu would hold onto Labrador and Newfoundland. The Ainu king rejected this deal and was suddenly on the receiving end of a declaration of war. The Canadian navy, newly built with innovations in cannon technology, managed to rout the Ainu navy at the Bay of Fortune in a decisive battle. Ever since, the Gulf has been in Canadian hands."
 the_ancient_kakizaki:0 "The Ancient Kakizaki"
 the_ancient_kakizaki_desc:0 "The Kakizaki dynasty of Hokkaido is one of the oldest on the Archipelago, with roots dating back to the final days of the Reiwa empire. Once the shogun formally took power from the puppet emperor, the Kakizaki line was placed in charge of a daimyo at Hokkaido. For the next millennium, the dynasty ruled various Kingdoms, daimyos, and duchies of different sizes. Now there are Kakizaki descendants throughout most of Hokkaido and the lower Archipelago, causing mild succession problems for the Ainu state."
 hokkaidian_nobles:0 "Last of the Ezo"
 hokkaidian_nobles_desc:0 "North of Sapporo, most of the Ainu live a more traditional lifestyle and follow native beliefs. They hunt and fish in loose settlements rather than the sophisticated city structures of the south. These Ainu are the last remaining ideal of the “Ezo” a legendary people from which the Ainu are said to be descendants of. Every new ruler of the Ainu Kingdom travels to the hinterlands in order to learn the skills of the ancients and gain righteous authority."

By the end of the 15th century, the Sultan of Ohio had conquered the minor lords of Kentucky and started to press into Antebella proper. Fearing the loss of their autonomy, the lords of Asheville, Fayetteville, and Charlotte formed a council of nations. In the fall of 1403, a council meeting at Charlotte turned bloody as the duke, Mathew Lockear, had the other two rulers executed. Mathew then took control of the former lands and united all of Carolina."

Upon the ascendance of the Locklears an aggressive strategy of repeat blockades and price cutting challenged the island rule. The House of Peachtree has responded through building a larger civil navy to specially protect merchants further into the rest of the Alabaman sea.

Historically this order has been in the service of the House of Luther, the old dynasty of the Dixie empire, however since the empire’s final collapse in the 11th century the order has offered their services in exchange for wealth and political favors.

In a special agreement with the region’s rulers, the Carolinians were allowed to keep their holdings in exchange for a yearly tribute.

These nobles were granted the land they still hold years ago, often splitting it among their children. This, alongside a general taboo against purchasing inherited land, has led  the internal borders of the Carolinian state to become increasingly complex. The thousands of small farms and divided homesteads are filled with influential nobles who fight tooth and nail to keep their titles. Any ruler of the Carolinian state must work together with these divided factions in order to keep the status quo and ensure their own head doesn’t end up in a noose."

The prophet of the Sacramental faith instructed his faithful disciple Peter to venture east to a land of cold known as Canada. Once there he would found a great empire and spread the word of the prophet across the continent. Peter did as the prophet asked and left behind an empire brimming with potential. The latter descendants of Peter slowly dismantled his empire amongst their sons, leaving bicking cousins where once was a golden civilization. At the dawn of the 12th century, one branch of the Peterson family managed to unite the lands surrounding Toronto and expand into Quebec. Under the mighty Ronald Peterson, the lands of the disciple were once again whole under the Maple Throne. Once his son Pierce finally took back the maritimes from Ainu rule after generations of war, he proclaimed himself Pierce Lafayette: liberator and emperor of Canada. His descendants would go on to conquer the lands of Canaan and beyond in the name of Peter, in the name of the Maple Throne."

The Canadian emperor would give preferential treatment to one company over another in order to advance his own aims. Though his power was absolute, major guilds resisting the emperor’s rule could lead to massive economic turmoil. The three major companies which dominate the state, the Hudsonian Company, the Superior Company, and the Acadian Company, have large ties into their respective regions. Working together with these companies and ensuring their compliance is a constant burden for the emperor."

When the explorers finally turned their sails east, they found only more cold and ice. The island of Greenland was worthless, but Pierce Lafayette was obsessed with the old myths. He allowed the Kyushans to pay off their war debts with Floridian slaves and tasked the Hudson company with settling the island using the new labor. Further settlement beyond Greenland was attempted, but any isles to the east remain undiscovered."

If his son, or his son’s son, or any decedent thereafter shall sin in a manner unforgivable, the public soul of the holy spirit will compel the people to rise up against them. In return the emperor is to be given the right to reign in the east. This essentially removed any notion of the emperor himself being divinely legitimate and enforced a constant pressure on the emperor to act in the people’s interest."

This split first became apparent when the successor to the American throne, the disciple David, established the United Church of Ogden, a religious body that would confirm priests of local churches according to an established doctrine. Peter roundly denounced this move and would quickly separate himself from the affairs of the west. Slowly over the course of centuries the two sects parted, going as far as to dispute the proper way to conduct the sacrament of Baptism. The formal split came in coordination with the Partisan-Sacramental split as the United Church of Ogden proclaimed itself the only body which could dictate church doctrine."

After taking the northern half of Michigan, the empire almost collapsed due to subsequent revolts in the Maritimes and Sota. As a measure of survival, Pierce split up the lands of Sota into a series of different tributary states. These states were mostly autonomous, but paid a yearly fee to the emperor in Toronto. Through this method the Lafayette line managed to unite The Great Lakes without revolt and implement their loyal rulers on foreign thrones."

Among these were the Sipahi Collective, Ulama Council, Bashaw Club, and Buckeye Order. The Siphai collective were a coalition of land owning cavalrymen who were tasked with tax farming on the frontiers of the peninsula. Meanwhile the Buckeye Order was primarily composed of the infantry-class Buckeyes who had sworn their allegiance to the Sultan rather than the Buckeye Vizier. The Bashaw Club represented the entrenched former tribal lords, a council of which included the historical twelve Ohio tribes.

During the latter half of his rule, Usman revoked the independence of these regions and converted their expert civil fleets into a robust navy.

Since the lands to the south were already settled and the Ohioans in the west had a fearsome reputation, most frontiersmen fled north into Wisconsin. Similarly, the settlers on the edge of the Canadian empire settled within Wisconsin to avoid laws in the expanding Dominion. When these empires finally fell, the lands of Wisconsin were left surrounded by hostile forces. In order to preserve their way of life, these frontiersmen banded together and established a state among the lands of Wisconsin.

When the Iowan caliphate burst onto the scene, the Sconnies were among the first to allow the free travel of Muslims throughout their lands.

It was no surprise then, when given the chance, Fredrick Lafayette invaded Wisconsin with brutal savagery. The once great cities of Green Bay, Appleton, Madison, and Kenosha were reduced to ash. In the aftermath the Kingdom of Wisconsin was reduced to nearly half its previous size and ever since has been brutally exploited by the Canadian empire.

Long caravans known as rails were filled with food and siege weapons to send to the front in order to support the war effort.

Many of these men used their earnings to buy herds of cattle and tended to them during peacetime while enlisting into the army during war. The boom in the cattle industry in Texas led to an oversaturation of beef in the market at the start of the 15th century, which precipitated the later inflation crisis of the 1430s and 1440s. For their wealth and role in ruining agricultural markets, the Vaqueros became a hated group amongst many farmers in Texas, yet their brutal efficiency on the battlefield has kept them in high demand."

Specifically during the 1410s a former priest known as Lawrence Crockett established the Crockite tradition. With the declining status of the Texan Empire in the century, Crockett preached an ascetic road to salvation which brought peace to the impoverished. Though few outright converted to the traditions of the faith, his message spread throughout the empire and created a general animosity against the Papal establishment."

Like the Americans, they held a land of vastly different cultures, but with the advantage of one united faith. The acceptance of other traditions was exemplified in an American-style congress in which any one person could come with their grievances directly to the emperor."

A series of Imperial Tariffs on the region in the 15th century destroyed trading prospects and choked many independent farmers. A group of riverlords, known as the Laredan Club, organized and launched a revolution from their city of origin. The climax of the revolution was the two year long campaign of Juan Griensen de El Paso in the east, in which he successfully captured the cities of Santa Fe, Roswell, Amarillo, Midland, and Odessa before drowning in an attempt to capture the island of Lubbock."

Eventually branded as heretics and driven to another nearby town of Terlingua, the women established their own society free of riverlord and imperial influence.

This first began with the Gordan Plague which ravaged the country and was only heighted with the conquest of Veracruz at the hands of the Oaxacans. In an attempt to combat their shrinking status the Huastecans initiated a policy of aggressive diplomatic expansion. Huastecan embassies were sent out not just to the lead corporate boards of Empresia, but individual Chief Executive Officers. A procession of 15 nobles were sent to keep constant placement in Mexico City close to the Pope himself. Constant pressure on the nobles of these states along with consistent gifts often swayed them over to the Huastecan side in conflicts.

The two families had feuded for generations and, after a dry spell in which the Huastecans refused to help the starving Totonacs, the head of the Totonac household challenged the Huastecans to a game of ball. The winner would forever leave Tajin. The event, known as “La Cumbre”, culminated in a Totonac victory. However, in the middle of the night as the Huastecans prepared to leave at dawn, the youngest son of the Totonacs revealed that they had cheated by deflating the ball slightly in the final quarter, making it easier for the Totonacs to hit. This revelation shocked the Huastecans who promptly slaughtered the Totonacs in the streets and in their homes.

By the 4th century they held the majority share of the College of Cardinals and would use this majority to dominate the papacy with their own aims for a century.

When the ensuing army gave chase, the Huastecans would turn and fire upon them. This deception was seen as an immoral act and was denounced by the pope himself.

In its current state it is comparable to cities of Toronto and San Francisco in America. When Emiliano I Mixteca of Oaxaca ascended the throne he decided that his nation would claim that jewel of the gulf. The spark for the conflict came over the control of Tres Zapotes, which the Oaxacans controlled, but was still recognized by the Huastecans as part of their realm. When the Huastecans sent down an army to collect taxes, a skirmish occurred outside of the city. The war lasted 4 years and was ended with the Treatise of the Humeros.

This being a time before the Cuban conversion, the primary route for invasion was through Louisiana into Alexandria. With the support of 60,000 Texans at their back, the Louisianians invaded Alexandria. Landing at Orange Beach, the Cajun Crusaders managed to quickly take the city and establish the temporary Alabaman Empire. However, a coalition of mainland Japanese dukes soon formed and quickly kicked out the state, starting the counter crusade."

During the resulting fire the Louisiaianian army of 10,000 men routed 30,000 Japanese and forced them to surrender."

As time marched forward, this league became more and more centralized around the rich Sippians in the east. Finally in a unanimous decision the league united into a single state at the start of the 15th century and ever since has posed a continuous threat to those in its south."

When the CEOs eyes’ began to fade after years of reading dense legal documentation, they invented spectacles that refracted light correctly to see.

As the Empire fell apart the newly independent Patriotic tribes blitzed south into Empresia and El Norte. It was at this point that it looked as if the Catolico world was doomed for collapse, but the Bajio endured.

After this point the Mayan state enacted a policy of mass road building. Entire swaths of jungles were leveled and mountains were carved to connect all aspects of the empire.

Instead of diminishing the power of the kingdom this has instead bolstered its legitimacy. When the Pope requested men from all corners of the Catolico world for the Northern Crusades, many kings forced their peasants into marching north.

Coffee is often cited as one of the compounding elements which led to the scientific revolution throughout Mexico in the late middle ages due to its energizing properties. The coffee trade collapsed when the pope declared it a drink of the devil and a “bitter invitation to sin” after Valladolid family’s denunciation of his authority.

These rulers have resorted to fabricating outrage among lesser dukes, sabotaging plantations, and assassinating important families in this new age. The sullen attitude of most in the region was best reflected in Tomas Correa’s series of sculptures on the “Paranoia de Paz”."

 masters_of_the_stars_desc:0 "The Andean civilization has historically had a focus on the heavenly bodies, crafting detailed maps of the stars and constellations. This fascination emerges from the dualistic nature of the Yanantin religion, seeing the fundamental competing forces of different natures being reflected in the stars. The limited contacts between the Andean civilizations and the northern Mexican continents were mostly characterized by the travelers and scholars who ventured to the far off land to learn the secrets of the universe."
 mita_revival:0 "Mita Revival"          
 mita_revival_desc:0 "The mit’a system was an ancient method of labor organization which saw a revival during the 12th and 13th centuries in Andean society. Particularly in relation to the arrival of crusaders whose new population brought intense demand for goods. The system relies on a limited amount of time of state required labor. In a roundabout way this functioned similar to a wealth tax as nobles would pay for professional laborers to take their place as well. In this way the andean civilizations were able to construct major road networks, temples, and navies."

 rise_of_the_tawantinsuyu_desc:0 "The great Incan empire of Tawantinsuyu was an ancient realm in the far south. It was rumored that at a time it dominated all of the Andes and even most of Colombia. Now its rise is set to begin again as the state has unified the local incan lords under the leadership of one great ruler. With threats from Brazil and Colombian incursions, the Incan lords are in a prime position to unite the Andes under the pretense of protection."
 ecuador_trail:0 "Ecuador Trail"          
 ecuador_trail_desc:0 "The largest trade network in the Andes is the great Ecuadorian Trail which runs from Guayaquil to Saigon. With the revival of the mit’a system the route is very well developed and dotted with many roadways. Colombian crusaders who arrived in the region were stunned by the complexity of the trade and began to even emulate it in their own state. The Ecuadorians who the trail is named after carry out most of the trade and have become emblematic of the exotic goods they peddle."
 the_southern_converts:0 "The Southern Converts"          
 the_southern_converts_desc:0 "The conversion of the Ecuadorians was a mix of migration and convenience. As more Colombians fled the turmoil in the north, they brought their values across into the realms of Ecuador. Many kings of Ecuador had already converted to the faith in order to assure loyalty to the domineering empire in their north. As time has gone on the faith has slowly creeped south throughout the continent and snuck its way into everyday life."
 duality_in_mind_and_spirit:0 "Duality In Mind And Spirit"          
 duality_in_mind_and_spirit_desc:0 "The primary Yanantin religion of the Andean region is focused on the appreciation of harmony in the world, specifically when it comes to the contrasting elements of life. Hundreds of local variations make the religion a more shared sense of values rather than a centralized faith, but its impact is similar from Ecuador to Vietnam. So it is no surprise that many fleeing Colombians who settled down within the region have begun to convert to the new faith and have been accepted with open arms."
 boats_on_the_malays:0 "Boats On The Malays"          
 boats_on_the_malays_desc: "Brazilian traders began to take interest in the Andean region upon the arrival of the Colombians. Their key port city of Singapore was in a prime position to ship goods further north and bypass the bare eastern route to the Caribbean. With increased Brazillian arrival led to many in the Andean region to attempt their own trading empires. Particularly, nobility on the peninsula invested heavily in the construction of ocean vessels throughout the 15th century."

 pirates_of_malays_desc:0 "During the early days of the Brazilian empire, Filipino pirates posed the greatest threat. The small ports along the isles served as repairing stations for a grand network of scallywags that spanned the southern side of the continent. It is due to heavy piracy that most coastal cities eventually diminished, even the great cities of Bangkok and Saigon. In modern times, the Brazilian patrolling fleet prevents most pirate action."
 island_blues:0 "Island Blues"          
 island_blues_desc:0 "Due to the heavily maritime nature of Filipino society, maintaining a prominent fleet became a necessary aspect of state maintenance. The creation of small states out of various pirate coves led to the conversion of the militarized naval vessels being used in offensive wars against their neighbors. The all out naval warfare that extended throughout the region has led to generations of lost sailors."
 brazilian_defense:0 "Brazilian Defense"          
 brazilian_defense_desc:0 "It started first with ports along Mindoro. Harmless, small ports. The Brazilians only wanted to trade a few of the farmed goods and fish for some gems. Then more traders arrived. The people of Mindoro were gracious for the new business, they bent their knees and swore fealty to their new emperor. The men of Manilla were not so gracious. When ships appeared in the hundreds, stocked full of gems for trade, the duke closed off the city. Soon, generosity turned to bloodshed and Manilla was reduced to an open field. What was done to Manilla will be done to our great cities if we are not clever and faster than that bloated emperor in the south."
 anito_guidance:0 "Anito Guidance"          
 anito_guidance_desc:0 "The Anito are a series of folk spirits which are essential to the Espiritismo sect in the Philippines. Similar to other Espiritismo sects, the act of communicating with the spirits and diving truth is a central aspect of statecraft and everyday life. In recent centuries, aspects of the indiginous religion have blended with more elements of Mexican Catholicism and Brazilian Espiritismo. This has led to a general greater tolerance amongst the Filipinos regarding the Catholic faith."
 filipino_network:0 "Filipino Network"          
 filipino_network_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the pirate period, the Philippine region was devoid of major maritime traffic, but slowly recovered as trust was restored in the Malay sea. In recent times the Filipinos hold an immense trade network focused on the maintenance of key waterways and the shipping of Brazilian goods further north."
 classical_malay_literature:0 "Classical Malay Literature"          
 classical_malay_literature_desc:0 "The center of classical Malay literature lies within the walls of Davao. Epic tales of gods, men, and creatures fill the countless libraries stored within the cities. Some of the most prolific works of the period, like the epic “The Fifth Bastion”, were written by a series of authors over the course of decades. This collaborative approach to fiction was best displayed with the “commons houses” of Davao, where sometimes as many as 30 wealthy poets would get together and write a work using each of their talents for particular portions. The legacy of this literature has been mostly contained to the educated of the region, but has taken off amongst the large wealthy noble class of Brazil."

Securing our island holdings and uniting under one banner might help us to prevent the empire from reaching its tendrils into our economy and eventually state structure. This dream, ideally achieved through diplomacy, would see our great state stand alongside our neighbors in a common protective pact."

The people of Victoria constructed crude naval vessels to sail across the lake and transport goods to those on the other side. For this purpose and more, the lake became the most important part of Australian civilization."

 desert_wanderers_desc:0 "To the west of the central lake, the wide desert of Australia stretches out for an immense distance. Those who traverse this brutal land have carved out techniques for survival. During invasion by colonial powers, Victorians often retreated deep into these deserts and lived off the land. Specially trained desert warriors from Nevada or Sonora were often drafted for the difficult task of taming these wayward soldiers."

With the arrival of the colonizers a similar approach was taken with many australian diplomats making their way to the shores of Japan, Cuba, Canada, and Alaska. Despite this the Victorians were more than often shifted to the side and exploited for their resources."

Particularly the inclusion of a zero within their numerical system was distinct even amongst certain American cultures of the time it was invented. The Australians used this in order to craft elaborate tablets filled with information regarding different trades."
 reef_dwellers:0 "Reef Dwellers"          
 reef_dwellers_desc:0 "The great barrier reef served as a deterrent for incoming colonial powers as frequent shipwrecks led to a stigma against the area. This combined with the Australian flu caused many Americans to think the island was cursed from the onset. The reef also supplied the coastal population with food through fishing in its diverse waters."
 music_of_the_outback:0 "Music Of The Outback"          
 music_of_the_outback_desc:0 "One of the most striking aspects of Victorian society was the focus on music within rituals and praise.

The former was known to exist for hundreds of years in the legends of Greenlanders who visited the northern reaches of the land on certain occasions. When the Canadians landed on New England they named the continent off of the old tale which had taught them of its existance. The latter was named after the famed explorer Juan Pablo Yuna who sailed alongside the Antillean fleet in discovering an eastward route to Colombia."

The mighty bundesland were often stimulated into fighting the more primitive surrounding tribes, however this would ultimately be their downfall. Upon the arrival of the Reiwans, the American Flu was passed throughout their society and severely crippled their capabilities."

 nomadic_societies_new:0 "Nomadic Societies"          
 nomadic_societies_new_desc:0 "The majority of new world societies were nomadic, moving from place to place with their state structure. Contact with these various nomadic groups often led to their destruction due to the American flu, but their isolated nature made it difficult for them to spread it further. Those societies that survived were often faced with the difficult choice of modernizing or returning to their previous mode of life. The latter often resulted in their colonization by the larger western powers."
 pablonian_exchange:0 "Pablonian Exchange"          
 pablonian_exchange_desc:0 "The Pablonian exchange brought many new goods to the Akilineq and Pablonian continents that were previously unheard of. Specifically, the presence of honeybees were vital to the mass agrarian nature of colonies which dotted the coasts of Yoroppa and Coyemia. As well, the arrival of horses in Pablonia and mooses in Akilineq revolutionized travel. Conversely, the camels from Fayettia became a staple within the deserts of Sonora and Nevada."

 diseases_of_the_americas_desc:0 "The most prominent aspect of the native interaction with the Americans was the prevalence of diseases. Hundreds of different strains, generally referred to as the “American Flu”, rampaged throughout the communities of Akilineq and Pablonia. This disease often left their respective communities without even a single member through the seasons. This was sometimes used to the advantage of the colonizers as they would purposefully spread their diseases to particularly resistant native communities."

From the ancient Brazilians, who charted the Malaysian sea and made contact with the proto-colombians, to their progeny in the 15th century, who now dominate the same waves, the Brazilians have held a long legacy of empire building.

This balance between encouraging growth while rearing control has been an eternal struggle for the Brazilian state."

 bickering_nobility_desc:0 "With a wealthy nation comes the problem of wealthy citizens. These citizens can impact the processes of governance in a way the average peasant cannot. Nowhere is this more true than within the Brazilian empire where the influence of nobility drives the engine of the state. Particularly, if the emperor undergoes an action which the nobles find repugnant then they will stop paying taxes. If military force is attempted the nobles will quickly hire foreign armies to dispose of the emperor and put a more suggestible person in the office. It is through this process that the emperor must wrangle against his own nobility, often through occupying them with different roles. The most common form of this distraction is placing them in charge of armies or universities with rigorous research."

The birth of the great fleet came during the pirate era of the Philippines which saw the scourge of the sea run rampant and dismantle the thriving trading network of Malaysia.

However, when there is a will for violence within the halls of the court, the empire’s engine of war is terrifying. The cities of Manilla, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur are a fraction of their former glory after their devastation at the hands of the Brazilians. The rarified air that the imperials hold their heads within justify any action, no matter how bloody."
