 evangelical_events.1.t: "Washed in the Blood"
 evangelical_events.1.d: "Through the fires of war and glut of bloodshed [Root.Monarch.GetName] has emerged as a different [Root.GetWomanMan]. Warfare is not frowned upon in Evangelical circles as it is in Ecclesial or Zahran ones. For this reason, Evangelical rulers have often held a dual role as both the leader of their own nation and the personal warden of the realm. For the Evangelical ruler, warfare is just another tool in their kit which they may use to expand their influence or ensure better lives for their people. In our current conflict, our ruler has taken on the role of warden personally as a general. Through this action, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has deepened their ties to the faith. Whether this new fervor is used to better support the war effort or bolster [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] grip on the nation is up to us to decide."
 evangelical_events.1.a: "Clean in His Eyes" 
 evangelical_events.1.b: "We are an inspiration!"
 evangelical_events.2.t: "Carrying Sin"
 evangelical_events.2.d: "The purification of sin through ritual is a central part of the Evangelical faith. The concept of being “born again” is held across many Sacramental and Christian sects, but forms the basis of the Evangelical world view. Evangelicals often hold these special rituals at key moments in their lives during which they are made into a new blank slate free of sin. It is not uncommon for those that undergo the ritual to change their entire outlook, move away from their current homes, and take up a new trade or passion. While this is a common practice for the faithful, Evangelical rulers tend to stay more private with this aspect of the faith due to the instability it can bring. The spontaneous nature of the ritual’s aftermath can sometimes spell doom for an unstable kingdom. This is the current circumstance which our ruler, [Root.Monarch.GetName], finds themselves in. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can either decide to go forward with the ceremony and risk looking weak to the public, or stay in their sinful state."
 we_are_on_the_path_to_be_born_again: "§GWe will begin the process of being born again§!"
 evangelical_events.2.a: "We must be born again!" 
 evangelical_events.2.b: "A waste of time"
 evangelical_events.3.t: "A Public Affair?"
 evangelical_events.3.d: "The exact nature of the sin cleansing ritual is often debated among Evangelical scholars. While there are many different schools of thought on which actions can clear the sin, debate is often centered on the role of observers in the ceremony. While a larger crowd would be more advantageous for affirming our rule, many scholars warn that a sinful crowd might taint the ceremony. To avoid this, we could select a smaller group of loyal advisors to watch the ceremony and report on their observance. On the other hand, we could stick to tradition and complete the ceremony only under the eyes of those involved. "
 evangelical_events.3.a: "Let all see!" 
 evangelical_events.3.b: "Just a few."
 evangelical_events.3.c: "This is personal."
 evangelical_events.4.t: "The Question of Baptism"
 evangelical_events.4.d: "For this ceremony of purification, we have decided to use the ritual of baptism. Baptism has long served as the default ritual for purification among Evangelicals and other Christians. Even Sacramentals practice baptism in their own faith, a fact which has led to confusion amongst Evangelicals about the precise difference between their faith and that of their neighbors. Despite all of this, the exact performance of baptism is still hotly debated between different Evangelical groups. Some claim that baptism only works if the sinful is submersed into the water, while others claim that the same effect is achieved through sprinkling the water. Some more extreme schools of thought claim that no water is necessary for the ritual. Instead, it can simply be achieved through personally connecting with the holy spirit. Whatever method we choose will no doubt impact our administration."
 evangelical_events.4.a: "Dunk me" 
 evangelical_events.4.b: "Just a sprinkle"
 evangelical_events.4.c: "Bathe me in the holy spirit alone"
 evangelical_events.5.t: "Born Again"
 evangelical_events.5.d: "Before the ritual, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was blinded by sin and the earthly temptations. Once the shroud was lifted, [Root.Monarch.GetName] emerged as a new [Root.GetWomanMan]. Every moving part of the earth sang its harmonious tune in [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s ears. From the smallest flowers to the largest creatures of the land, all were seemingly connected under the almighty’s design. For just a moment, [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s role in the world made sense. With this new outlook, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked towards the future and the role that our realm should play in The Almighty’s design. For too long, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had followed the movements of the day. Now, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would take a new path. Not one decided by those scholars and pedants who spent their lives optimizing, but one that spoke to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 evangelical_events.5.a: "I am a new [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan]" 
 evangelical_events.6.t: "Seeding"
 evangelical_events.6.d: "Evangelicals believe that God rewards those that invest in Him. Unlike other religions, charity is not something explicitly called for by Evangelical scholars. Instead, individuals are compelled to give out of the divine returns which come from investment. Many Evangelical kings have given up almost all of their earthly gains in an attempt to double, triple, or even quadruple their earnings. Some scholars have disavowed this theory, claiming it as a way for different churches to swindle the money out of the hands of the common [Root.GetWomanMan]. However, we are no common [Root.GetWomanMan]. As the ruler of a powerful realm, we ought to invest some of our funds to ensure that our posterity can live rich lives such as ours. Who better to trust with our investments than the almighty Himself."
 evangelical_events.6.a: "Trust in Him." 
 evangelical_events.6.b: "Foolish!"
 we_will_potentially_get_money_in_five_years.tt: "§GOur money will potentially quintuple in five years§!"
 evangelical_events.7.t: "God's Gifts"
 evangelical_events.7.d: "Our wise investment in The Lord has paid off. After donating money to the churches of the realm, they began to expand their congregations and beautify the land. Throughout the Evangelical world, travelers now flock to our realm in order to worship. More importantly, they have begun to lavishly give to the churches. A joint gift from the churches of the realm was presented before [Root.Monarch.GetName], a sum five times greater than what we had initially invested. Let us savor this moment of success and give thanks to the lord, who has once again provided for our people better than we ever could."
 evangelical_events.7.a: "Wonderful!" 
 evangelical_events.8.t: "Money in the Breeze"
 evangelical_events.8.d: "Our investment in the churches of the land has led to nothing but waste. A year ago, we placed a portion of our funds into the hands of the holy, who were supposed to use it in order to enrich the very soul of our realm. Instead, these churches used the money we provided to them to enrich their own elders. Across the countryside, the lavish manors of these wannabe lords now stand as monuments to their greed. We were foolish to invest in this manner instead of something more stable and have been embarrassed in front of the public accordingly. Let us hope that we can rebuild our wealth in time."
 evangelical_events.8.a: "We were foolish." 
 evangelical_events.9.t: "Ready to Give"
 evangelical_events.9.d: "A populace which is fervorous in their worship will be less critical of our administration. With our current debts, many advisors have brought up the potential notion of leveraging this worship to raise a temporary tax on the people. Doing this would no doubt bolster our treasury and allow us to more quickly rid ourselves of the debt, but also act as a test run to see how much our administration can get away with while the people are distracted with worship. It is important to remember that implementing this tax will likely slow down the fervorous worship of the realm. It may take years to once again build up this level of devotion to the Evangelical faith. "
 evangelical_events.9.a: "What loyal subjects." 
 evangelical_events.9.b: "We will not exploit our position!"
 evangelical_events.10.t: "Gospel of Wealth"
 evangelical_events.10.d: "While there is no explicit compulsion for Evangelicals to give away their hard earned earthly riches, many harbor negative feelings against those who hoard their wealth. Our administration now holds an excess budget which we may give away to further boost our populace’s opinion of our rule. Depending on how much we give, we may inspire those throughout the nation to better devote their lives to the Evangelical faith and further throw themselves into worship. A more devout nation will no doubt grant even greater riches into the future. We should seriously consider the prospect of giving away this wealth, for the good of our people and their fate after death."
 evangelical_events.10.a: "Money for All!" 
 evangelical_events.10.b: "It is our duty to give."
 evangelical_events.10.c: "Just a little" 
 evangelical_events.10.e: "It is all mine!"
 evangelical_events.11.t: "The Spiritually Gifted"
 evangelical_events.11.d: "From [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName], a local preacher has shocked our realm with their mastery of the scripture and talent for speaking. Deep in the countryside, massive crowds have gathered to hear the preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] speak on the matters of the day and give guidance to those who are struggling. Cities across the realm are clamoring for them to visit, not just for their wonderful words, but also for their very generous fans. Such individuals only arise once in a generation, so it would be wise for our administration to keep track of their current allegiances and messages lest they weaponize their stardom. Whatever the case, they have certainly bolstered belief among the faithful of our nation. Such fervorous worship can only lead to success for our administration and future goals. "
 evangelical_events.11.a: "Wonderful." 
 evangelical_events.12.t: "Preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] Dies"
 evangelical_events.12.d: "In a sad turn of events, the preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] finally moved on today. For years, they had served as an ambassador of the Evangelical faith and brought many people to the proper form of worship. Through it all, the preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] was one of the most celebrated individuals to ever emerge from our nation. As our populace begins to mourne, we must ensure that the preacher’s words are not forgotten. Future generations must be made to hear the preacher’s wonderful words and be brought to worship just as our populace is now. Let us take just a moment to remember their legacy and reflect on what has been lost."
 evangelical_events.12.a: "Our Nation Mourns." 
 evangelical_events.13.t: "Warrior of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName]"
 evangelical_events.13.d: "In times of war, a nation’s populace must remain united in order to succeed. Every facet of society must be focused on the single goal of victory or be adjusted to that aim. Other nations typically struggle with maintaining religious hegemony due to the incongruent messages of peace preached by their heathen faiths. However, Evangelicalism holds no such qualms against fighting foes who are unabashedly evil. For our own interests, we have recently gained an unexpected religious ally out of the preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName]. While they typically avoided warfare in their sermons, the preacher recently proclaimed the divine importance of our current conflict. In a masterful speech, the preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] put the sins of our enemy on full display and called for their follower’s contribution to our victory. The inspirational message has already begun to spread throughout the realm and inspire our soldiers to fight with all of their strength."
 evangelical_events.13.a: "They will inspire the troops!" 
 evangelical_events.14.t: "Preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] Challenges Authority"
 evangelical_events.14.d: "Our administration now suffers from a crisis of legitimacy. Few in our realm see our ruler as holding a legitimate claim to their station, and many have called for us to voluntarily step down. However, one of these calls has begun to gain more traction than many others. The preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] recently challenged our authority as ruler during one of their many sermons. The preacher implied that they would be far more efficient at ruling the country if they were given the chance. Further, our advisors have begun to warn of a plot for rebellion which the preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] may be planning in their very home province. We now face one of the most difficult choices of our administration. We can either step down from our position and let the preacher take the reins, or fight to the very end against our own people."
 evangelical_events.14.a: "Let them reign." 
 evangelical_events.14.b: "Crush them!" 
 evangelical_events.15.t: "Preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] offers assistance"
 evangelical_events.15.d: "While our administration continues to thrive, the preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] has offered their assistance to take our prosperity to new heights. Bored with preaching the same humdrum messages day after day to an uncritical audience, the preacher has offered to become a part of our administration and do something different. With their skillset, our advisors have created three options for how the preacher could possibly fit into our administration. First, they could serve as a theologian in our innermost cabinet. Using the preacher of [local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] for such a position would be much cheaper than any other alternatives. On the other hand, we could also add the preacher into the ranks of our own missionaries and send them to convert the heretic or heathen masses. Some of our advisors have even suggested rejecting the offer as they believe that the preacher is much more useful to our administration in their current position. "
 evangelical_events.15.a: "They would be a wonderful theologian" 
 evangelical_events.15.b: "They would be a powerful mimssionary"
 evangelical_events.15.c: "[local_province_of_the_preacher_evangelical.GetName] needs them more than we do." 
 evangelical_events.16.t: "Evangelical Declarations"
 evangelical_events.16.d: "The Evangelical minority of our nation has grown tired of the current state of affairs and is now calling for greater investment in their communities. For centuries, many in our administration have avoided investing funds in these heretic and heathen provinces. This abandonment has left most Evangelical communities lagging behind the rest of the realm in development and prosperity. To remedy this supposed injustice, the Evangelicals have requested that we set aside a portion of the royal funds so that their communities are able to recover and grow alongside our faithful. We must consider this decision carefully, as to not legitimize their religion while still caring for our subjects."
 evangelical_events.16.a: "Give them what they ask for" 
 evangelical_events.16.b: "No special treatment"
 evangelical_events.17.t: "Crushing Holy Spirits"
 evangelical_events.17.d: "In the province of [crushing_holy_spirits_province.GetName] the Evangelical minority of our nation has begun to create more trouble for our administration. A large revival led by a famed Evangelical preacher is currently taking place in [crushing_holy_spirits_province.GetName]. So far, most of the sermons have been critical of our administration and have riled up the local populace into resisting our rule. For this reason, some of our advisors have suggested that we send in the military to shut down the affair. Doing so would no doubt provoke a revolt from the local people, but it might also work towards crushing the Evangelical faith in the province for good. On the other hand, letting them continue their worship might just help the province in the long term as the community continues to strengthen and improve itself."
 evangelical_events.17.a: "Penalize Them!" 
 evangelical_events.17.b: "Take Agressive Action"
 evangelical_events.17.c: "Let them be" 
 evangelical_events.18.t: "Elders Demand Recognition"
 evangelical_events.18.d: "Evangelical society is led by elders, each of whom leads their own congregation and is able to deliver the scripture. Our own Evangelical population does not operate this way, as to not legitimize their heretical beliefs. Instead, we have installed local leaders who work with the elders in order to ensure that they cannot amass power and carry out Evangelical plots. This state of being is rife with corruption and dissatisfaction all around. Many of these elders from throughout the realm have traveled to the capital in order to air their grievances and call for more direct collaboration with our administration. Our advisors have heavily warned against this, seeing it as a step towards total collaboration with heathens. While this would certainly be the public’s perceptions, rejecting the offer may have more dire consequences for our state. An angry population of Evangelicals might lead to all out revolt and religious violence."

 evangelical_events.19.t: "Interfaith Revivals"
 evangelical_events.19.d: "Our administration’s messages of tolerance and acceptance have begun to take root, especially in the Evangelical communities of our nation. Revivals were once a gathering place for the most faithful and fervorous of Evangelical society, but have now been opened to all those who wish to worship. Jews, Muslims, and even Sacramentals have begun to travel to these interfaith affairs in order to feel connected to their Abrahamic brothers. While there is still so much war and strife between the religions of this world, let us take a moment and enjoy the beautiful collaboration that can come from a lack of judgment in a nation so splendid as ours."
 evangelical_events.19.a: "Wonderful!" 
 evangelical_events.20.t: "Shattered Faith"
 evangelical_events.20.d: "For centuries, the Evangelical faith stood as a monument to the ancient peoples of this continent in the east. The faith was fundamentally tied to the lands of Dixie, in a way which few could ever understand. Now, just as all things tend to do, the Evangelical world has crumbled into dust. No kingdom rules under the watchful eyes of its fervorous God, and even fewer accept its followers as a part of their populace. This presents our administration with the most splendid of opportunities, as the formerly faithful Evangelicals begin to question their place in the world we can swoop in and ensure that they come to the one true faith. Throughout the lands, the last cries of a dying faith are struggling to be heard. Let us give its followers a path to true enlightenment and comfort them in these difficult times."
 evangelical_events.20.a: "They will be born again" 
 evangelical_events.21.t: "A New World Mission"
 evangelical_events.21.d: "Beyond the waves there is an entire world of heathen natives who have not heard the proper word of The Almighty. Something must be done about this in order to ensure that their souls are not lost into damnation just for their unfortunate ignorance. Our advisors have implored us to consider an overseas mission. Drafted from the most faithful and fervorous of our society, such a mission would land in [new_world_mission_province.GetName] and attempt to convert the colonists and natives. While it is likely that such a mission would draw the ire of [new_world_mission_province.Owner.ColonialParent.GetName], the potential success of a mission would be greatly beneficial for the Evangelical faith. After all, what is a little bit of animosity and supplies worth compared to a saved soul?"

 evangelical_events.22.d: "Beyond the shore, just over the horizon, a large boat now sailed towards our shores. When it arrived, it was full of a strange sort who claimed to be from the old world. However, they were not from our homeland, but instead from a land of heathens and devils. These Evangelicals set themselves up outside of [new_world_mission_province.GetName], and began to preach to our townspeople and the natives. Such a horrid thing to do, settle right next to a thriving community and disturb them with constant preaching. While they are too numerous for us to do anything about currently, we must ensure that they are dealt with before they can spread their heathenous ideas to these poor souls in this new world."

The people of [new_world_mission_province.GetName] have destroyed our mission and slaughtered our followers. This news has mobilized our populace against their nation and inspired heavy national fervor. Let us not be discouraged by this outcome, they gave their lives so that we could learn of the new world’s dangers. Maybe in the future, we can try again and garner more success."
 evangelical_events.23.a: "Damn them!"
 evangelical_events.24.t: "The Foreign Sort"
 evangelical_events.24.d: "A band of foreign men have arrived at our borders, bearing gifts of gold and books. It is obvious that they want us to convert to their foreign faith and devote our lives to their god. For centuries we have followed the faith of our ancestors and stuck to their beliefs, but we live in a new age of disease and death. The miasma that these foreigners have brought with them cleaves our population by the day, leaving us open to attack by our neighbors. Accepting their foreign faith could grant us a powerful ally and ensure the survival of our people. We must seriously consider their proposal, for the sake of our survival and the preservation of our traditions."

 evangelical_events.25.d: "Promising news has emerged from across the waves, as our mission has had success with some of the native peoples. They were quick to convert to our faith once they heard the world of the almighty, just as planned. Through the actions of our wonderful mission, we have saved their souls from eternal damnation and even potentially gained an ally in the new world. Word of this success has already begun to inspire our populace. Let us hope that more come to their senses and believe in the one, true faith."

While they were receptive to the mission’s gifts of gold and gems, they cared little for the word of the almighty. Such is the case of the simple people, who cannot reckon with what is to be gained through eternal life. Hopefully, future attempts at conversion will fare better."

 evangelical_events.27.d: "Grave news has emerged from across the seas as our attempted mission in the lands of [new_world_mission_province.GetName], has been crushed by the native people of [From.GetName]. In a swift move, the natives captured and slaughtered the members of the mission who led them back to [new_world_mission_province.GetName]. At which point, the townspeople were slaughtered or forced to convert to their crude beliefs. Let us take a moment to remember those who gave their lives so that we could learn the true dangers of the new world. Hopefully, in the future, we can be more successful with a new mission."
 evangelical_events.27.a: "Damn!"
 evangelical_events.28.t: "Natives Attack Evangelical Mission"
 evangelical_events.28.d: "The Evangelical mission in the province of [new_world_mission_province.GetName] has been attacked and looted by natives. By either slaughtering or forcing the conversion of the townspeople, the natives have rooted out those festering Evangelicals and ensured that their mission would be unable to continue. This interesting development requires our absolute attention, as we could now potentially reign in the province and reestablish control over the weak native peoples."

 evangelical_events.29.t: "Evangelical Scourge"
 evangelical_events.29.d: "The Evangelical mission in [new_world_mission_province.GetName] has led astray many of our own followers. The ratlike missionaries offered help to colonists in exchange for conversion and cult-like devotion. Throughout our realm, many provinces are now declaring their outright conversion to the new faith and beginning to disavow their previous commitments. We must act quickly and spell an end to their mission once and for all."

 evangelical_events.30.t: "Colonial Nation Swayed"
 evangelical_events.30.d: "Great news has emerged from across the sea as our own mission has managed to convert many provinces in the colonial nation of [new_world_mission_province.Owner.GetName]. While this is a wonderful success, they should be careful to not attract too much attention and potentially anger their colonial overlords."
 evangelical_events.30.a: "Wonderful!"
 evangelical_events.31.t: "An Intense Nation"
 evangelical_events.31.d: "Evangelicals are some of the most religiously devout folks on the American continent. More than Sacramentalism and Islam, Evangelicalism is ever present in its followers lives. The devotion of a realm’s populace is often expressed in their level of fervor, or devotion, to the faith. Our nation now finds itself devoted to one of its many fervorous pursuits, but with a populace that is more eager than usual. For this reason, many of our advisors have suggested directing our populace’s fervor towards a particular aim. Whether this be more devotion, assistance with our administration, or calming tensions, this eagerness will greatly benefit our administration."

 evangelical_events.31.b: "I'll take the focus."
 evangelical_events.31.c: "Let us temper ourselves."
 evangelical_events.32.t: "Strained Faithful"
 evangelical_events.32.d: "While the fervor that our populace continues to exude is useful for our administration, it can sometimes lead to self destructive behaviors for those involved. Some will sell all of their possessions, just to be connected to the almighty. Others will walk for days without food or water to revivals in order to hear the words of talented preachers. Sometimes, we must temper our population’s fervor and let them calm down. Our advisors have suggested that we enact such an action and lower the fervor of our populace before they begin to run wild, yet such an action would weaken our state. We must consider the health of our populace as well as our own interests when making this difficult decision."
 evangelical_events.32.a: "Everyone calm down."
 evangelical_events.32.b: "Let them run widl!"
 evangelical_events.33.t: "Lack of Enthusiasm"
 evangelical_events.33.d: "While most Evangelical states typically have a populace which will wholeheartedly  throw themselves into worship at a simple command, ours is beginning to show a lack of enthusiasm. Without much fervor, it will be difficult to keep our realm in line and continue the basic functions of our administration. Some of our advisors have suggested that we step in and encourage greater actions from preachers and host our own revivals. Following these steps would no doubt embolden our populace, but it would require the oversight of one of our own missionaries. If we can afford to set aside such a useful asset, this move would no doubt put us back on the righteous path."
 evangelical_events.33.a: "A missionary will set them straight."
 evangelical_events.33.b: "We will recover in time."
 evangelical_events.34.t: "Excess Fervor"
 evangelical_events.34.d: "Our populace is currently deeply invested within their own worship, to the point that our administration can capitalize on their faith for our own benefit. Many of our current aims could be refitted to serve a holier purpose and accomplished with the help of a pious populace. Using their religious fervor, we could bolster our administration, diplomacy, military, or even all three. This perfect combination of fervor and timing so rarely comes along, we would be fools not to take advantage of it. Let us use their worship to further our aims."

 evangelical_events.35.t: "Wartime Unity"
 evangelical_events.35.d: "With the combination of our fervorous obsession and current state of war, some of our advisors have proposed that we shift our populace’s focus on achieving victory. While this might cause them to become further exhausted by the conflict, it could just as well inspire those on the front lines to fight harder. Such an exchange would provide our administration with the strength that it needs to achieve victory. On the other hand, we could relieve some of the current tension and give our populace a break from the difficulties of conflict. Less tension could give our population more time to fight before the internals of our realm break down."
 evangelical_events.35.a: "We need everyone working towards victory!"
 evangelical_events.35.b: "Let us relieve some of the tension."

 evangelical_events.36.d: "Evangelical and Ecclessial. They even sound similar. When the Sacramentals first arrived with Peter’s flock there was some confusion as to the similarity between the religions of the Evangelicals and the other Abrahamic ones. However, it was soon found that those in Dixie shared more in common with the Mexicans than the wild Sacramentals. Yet, as time has gone on, the eastern Sacramentals have only become more indistinguishable from their Evangelical neighbors. Their denominational structure, born again theology, and lack of a central church still astounds scholars. A recent delegation from our Ecclesial neighbors has confused many in our capital’s court, as they claim that we follow the same exact faith. They cite the aforementioned shared tenets and our proximity as key reasons. While we certainly are sure of our faith, they do make an interesting case for our practice being more Ecclesial than Evangelical."
 evangelical_events.36.a: "That makes sense."
 evangelical_events.36.b: "We would never fall for such tricks!"
 evangelical_events.37.t: "Doomsday Prediction"
 evangelical_events.37.d: "A common practice among some less reputable Evangelical preachers is that of prediction. Often, these preachers will predict events that are to come in the near future, something so general that it is bound to happen. However, occasionally a preacher will outright predict the end of all time. Such doomsday predictions are typically met with criticism from some Evangelicals, but panic from others. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has recently begun to see visions in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dreams of a world crumbling away, the capital set alight, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] death by the hands of an assassin. While [Root.Monarch.GetName] has made slight mentions of these visions to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has not gone far enough to announce it to the public."
 evangelical_events.37.a: "Of course it is correct!"
 evangelical_events.37.b: "a fantastic tale."
 order_will_be_restored_after_a_year.tt: "§GWe will predict that the world will end next year. If this prediction is false, order will be restored at that time.§!"
 evangelical_events.38.t: "Doomsday"
 evangelical_events.38.d: "The horrible nightmares of [Root.Monarch.GetName] have come true. In the dead of night, a great stone from the heavens struck into [Root.Capital.GetName] and set the city alight. Thousands perished in an instant and many more died in the aftermath as a great fire burned across the countryside. [Root.Monarch.GetName] managed to escape the chaos, only to be found dead with a gash across [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throat. The nation is in chaos as many scramble to leave the collapsing administration and economy. Without clear leadership or centralized control, it is unlikely that we will ever recover."
 evangelical_events.38.a: "Oh No!"
 evangelical_events.39.t: "Cosmic Dissapointment"
 evangelical_events.39.d: "The nightmares of [Root.Monarch.GetName] seem to have been nothing more than visions as no doomsday has come to pass. While many of our populace are enraged at the false prediction, they have also returned to a state of complacency without the end of all things looming over them. With our newfound stability, we should take a moment to relish in the fact that the almighty has not decided to end it all on this day. When the end of all time eventually comes, we will be more ready due to this false prediction."
 evangelical_events.39.a: "We Still Stand."
 evangelical_events.40.t: "Devils of the Countryside"
 evangelical_events.40.d: "Due to the decentralized nature of the Evangelical faith, there are a variety of folk beliefs which are held by members of the populace. Some of these beliefs involve the existence of folk saints, but more frightening are the devils which are said to terrorize those in the countryside. Occasionally, members of our populace will become concerned that the countryside is packed with such devils and that they will eventually come for them. While many Evangelical scholars dismiss this notion, it might do us well to investigate it. Hopefully, once we prove that such devils are not out in the world, our populace will be able to return to their worship once again."
 evangelical_events.40.a: "We must investigate."
 evangelical_events.40.b: "Uneducated fools."
