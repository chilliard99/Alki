 nan_events.1.t: "Rich and Poor"
 nan_events.1.d: "In every society, there are those who are gifted and those who are not. Ever since the world was crafted, this has been the natural order. However, throughout the lives of men, many have struggled to change this status quo. Of course, there is no harm in making the lives of the lower rung less brutish as long as those in positions of power can continue to thrive. It is our duty to ensure that this remains. Sometimes, we are forced to disrupt the natural balance and guide our nation into a particular direction. We now find ourselves under these circumstances, as the poor and rich of our nation request affirmation from our administration. Their cries must be heard, reasoned, and acted upon to ensure that all remains one."
 nan_events.1.a: "The poor."
 nan_events.1.b: "The rich."
 nan_events.2.t: "King and Subject"
 nan_events.2.d: "Every member of the Ñanliku world must do their part in ensuring balance. Any tree chopped down to feed the fire must be replaced with a sapling. Any drink offered to guests must be consumed by oneself. These are menial tasks. Some are thrown into this world and given choices of greater importance. These individuals are to be rulers, and those below them subjects. It is important to remember that the status of ruler does not make one inherently better than those below them, rather they carry a greater burden and are more justly rewarded. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has done much reflecting on the nature of this relationship and concluded that…"
 nan_events.2.a: "We must bolster our strength."
 nan_events.2.b: "We serve the people."
 nan_events.3.t: "Father and Son"
 nan_events.3.d: "Throughout the ages, the Ñanliku have prioritized certain fundamental relationships which are said to be critical to maintain the natural order of the world. Among the most important of these are the relationships between fathers and sons. It is the duty of fathers to raise their sons in a manner that prepares them for the world and best reinforces their talents. It is the duty of sons to respect their fathers and learn from their wisdom. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s own son, [Root.Heir.GetName], broke a valuable family relic while playing around the royal quarters. Upon discovering the shattered pieces of the heirloom, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to deal with the situation by…"
 nan_events.3.a: "Punish."
 nan_events.3.b: "Forgive."
 nan_events.4.t: "Friend and Friend"
 nan_events.4.d: "The task of maintaining the world is not an easy one to do alone. It is useful, in times of trouble and beyond, to have friends who may bear a part of the burden. It is our duty to support those who have supported us in their time of need. Currently, our ally of [nice_ally_who_will_get_our_support.GetName] is in the midst of a war. As a gesture of support, many in our administration have suggested that we send them some aid using our national resources. Disagreements have arisen amongst our ministers as to what the exact content of this aid should be. If we were to send them military resources, that might bring our nation closer to the dark. However, if we were to just send them relief aid, our nation would likely be dragged towards a period of light."
 nan_events.4.a: "We shall send them military support."
 nan_events.4.b: "We shall send them relief resources."

 nan_events.5.t: "Friends Among the Ñan"
 nan_events.5.d: "Our allies in [From.GetName] have sent us a care package to assist in our war efforts. While they are not of our piosu [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, they have remained valuable allies and supported us in all of our endeavors. If they are ever to come into conflict or experience significant hardship, we would do well to consider returning this great favor."
 nan_events.5.a: "Wonderous!"
 nan_events.6.t: "Husband and Wife"
 nan_events.6.d: "The bond between husband and wife is separable by only the folly of man. Ñanliku law states that marriage between a man and a woman forms a fundamental bond which is made a part of the natural order. To separate such a bond is to move one towards light or dark. The actions taken by those within the bond are counted as one in the same. For months, [Root.Consort.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetName] have attempted to conceive and bring an heir to [Root.GetName]. Consulting with Ñanliku mystics, the couple was informed that they must concentrate on impacting the natural order and meditate on the matter. After a long session of contemplation they came to the conclusion that they must…"
 nan_events.6.a: "Populate the world."
 nan_events.6.b: "Wait until another day."
 nan_events.7.t: "Craftsmand and Farmer"
 nan_events.7.d: "There are those who take from the world and those who add to the world. Among the former, there are those that make from the earth and those that make with their hands. The craftsmen and farmers of our nation have always battled for attention. Our forefathers carefully split their focus between the two to ensure that one group never eclipsed the other. In the provinces of [province_of_the_craftsmen_nan.GetName] and [province_of_the_farmer_nan.GetName], growing populations of craftsmen and farmers have begun to demand that we support their ventures. Of course, we have plenty of resources to supply them both with what they need, but we must support only one. Such is the natural order."
 nan_events.7.a: "Favor the Craftsmen"
 nan_events.7.b: "Favor the Farmers"
 nan_events.8.t: "Brother and Sister"
 nan_events.8.d: "The history of Ñan is one dominated by Tawantinsuyu. When the Incans first conquered the four corners of the Andes all of those years ago, they brought with them their appreciation for the natural order. Originally it was believed that only they could manipulate the balance of the world. However, as more Andean societies began to adopt the faith it became more inclusive. In our modern age, the faith is available to all of those who wish to practice it. Despite this, it is still important for our nation to maintain an equal balance of power amongst the different populations. The pendulum has swung too far in one of the directions. Shall we choose to value those of the [Root.Culture.GetName] culture or those outside of it?"
 nan_events.8.a: "We are united!"
 nan_events.8.b: "Above all."
 ever_province_of_other_culture_will_get_this_nan.tt: "Every owned province that is in §Y[Root.Culture.GetGroupName]§! Culture Group, but not [Root.Culture.GetName] will get the following modifier:"
 nan_events.9.t: "Artist and Merchant"
 nan_events.9.d: "Art and commerce share an interesting relationship. In times of wealth, art blooms. It is the wealthy who commission art, yet it is often the wealthy that restrain art. They wish for it to fit to their likings rather than the vision of the artist. The merchant must have the art his way, if it deviates it may reflect poorly on his status. This follows according to the natural order. Those who have come before us have carefully mediated the influence of these two competing forces to ensure that balance is maintained. If too much power is given to the merchants, they will trample the artist. However, if too much power is given to the artists, they will no longer need the merchant. An excess of funds has recently been found within our administration’s budget. The merchants and artists of our nation have begun to clamor for these scraps. We must decide where the money will go."
 nan_events.9.a: "Fund the artists."
 nan_events.9.b: "Fund the merchants."
 nan_events.10.t: "Light and Dark"
 nan_events.10.d: "Actions can be split into two different groups: Light and Dark. Light actions are not inherently good, nor dark inherently bad. Instead, the actions just are. They exist in the context of the natural order. The agency of man allows him to impact the balance of actions. In plain nature, light and dark balance themselves out. To preserve the world for future generations and prevent a total collapse, we must dedicate ourselves to perform light actions with dark in all circumstances. However, sometimes it is impossible to achieve this aim. Resources are finite and there are some who do not share our point of view. Under such circumstances it is important to dedicate ourselves towards a particular direction so that we may achieve balance over time."
 nan_events.10.a: "Light"
 nan_events.10.b: "Dark"
 nan_events.11.t: "Blinding Light"
 nan_events.11.d: "Light blinds one to the problems of the state. When one is always happy, they see no need for improvement. Cracks begin to form. They hide themselves among the most pleasant of feelings. In an instant, one’s world can come crashing down. As our nation hurls itself into a period of light, we have trended towards complacency. Our citizens no longer notice the rot in their fields, the pestilence in the street, and the fire in their homes. Instead, they continue to march forward and enjoy the bliss of ignorance. It is our duty to resist this change, to restore the natural balance of our nation and maintain clear minds. We must act quickly, before all is consumed in the blinding light."
 nan_events.11.a: "Resist."
 nan_events.11.b: "Give in."
 nan_events.12.t: "Blurred Edges"
 nan_events.12.d: "When Ñanliku lose balance within their societies, the fundamental relationships that hold them together begin to break down. Among the most important of these relationships is that between subject and ruler. There must always be a separation between those who are ruled and those who rule. This is part of the fundamental order of the world. Without this separation, decisions would be endlessly debated and progress would halt. Our citizens have begun to question the importance of this relationship, a problem which has been exacerbated by the extreme lack of balance in our nation. They have taken to the city streets, demanding that we give up our crown and kao tao to their demands. [Root.Monarch.GetName] hears their pleas and decides to…"
 nan_events.12.a: "Assert our authority."
 nan_events.12.b: "Let the people reign."
 nan_events.13.t: "Fading Brilliance"
 nan_events.13.d: "Our nation has survived many hardships. At some point, all Ñanliku people face periods of light and dark. It is the actions of men during these times that determines their worth. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has more than proved [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] worth through [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] actions. Guiding our nation through difficult times, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has successfully maintained stability and prevented total collapse. With such clarity we can begin the task of rebalancing our nation. Let us call upon those who love their country and wish to help. We will once again return to the natural order, in time."
 nan_events.13.a: "Return to the natural order."
 nan_events.13.b: "Exploit this development."
 nan_events.14.t: "Army Cloaked in Light"
 nan_events.14.d: "War is a product of man. You will find no animals who form nations and fight against their kind, for such a thing is against the natural order. Ever since man has learned how to harness the power of his violence he has used it against his brothers and sisters. We currently find ourselves involved in this messy business. In times such as these, it is almost preferable to hold an unbalanced society. Our excess of light has provided our nation with many options for defeating our enemies. May Inti provide us with the strength we need to claim victory and return us to the natural fold by his mercy."
 nan_events.14.a: "Our cannons will light the skies ablaze."
 nan_events.14.b: "Our guns will fire in union."
 nan_events.14.c: "The sun shall protect us with its warmth."
 nan_events.14.e: "We will learn under the light."
 nan_events.15.t: "Bright Money"
 nan_events.15.d: "All men are corrupt. Our very agency ensures it. In the natural order of the world there can be no deals which are shady and which are pure. Yet, the imbalance of our state has exposed a number of dealings which have occurred in a manner which moves our society towards the dark. These transactions have increased the corruption of our state and caused many in our society to lose their fortunes. Undoubtedly, this has brung harm to our nation. We could easily use a portion of our royal funds to stop the transactions and restore order, but this would rob us of a valuable opportunity to swing our nation back towards total balance. We must decide whether to tolerate the continued corruption of our people for the sake of restoring the natural order."
 nan_events.15.a: "Purify the transaction."
 nan_events.15.b: "Balance above all."
 nan_events.16.t: "Power of Light"
 nan_events.16.d: "Ñanliku history is defined by its periods of light. During times of balance, little is written as it would require double the effort to maintain balance. During times of dark, little is written because society trends towards war and other unsavory actions. Light brings with it attention. This is a double edged sword for Ñanliku rulers. On one hand, their successes receive an inordinate amount of praise. On the other hand, their failures are scrutinized deeply by their populace. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proved their ability to serve as a sublime Ñanliku ruler during this period of light. With such great attention [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] actions now could help to bolster the status of our nation or bring it back into the natural order."
 nan_events.16.a: "An example to others."
 nan_events.16.b: "Return to the fold."
 nan_events.17.t: "Under the Sun"
 nan_events.17.d: "Periods of light in Ñan are most often associated with the sun. Stories passed down through the ages tell that the very weather is changed by the imbalancing actions of man. The sun’s heat shines brightly down on our nation. It cracks the soil of farmer’s fields, dries up the wells of the countryside, and wears down the common man. The pious among our citizenry have come to realize that this heat originates from our misguided actions. Our inability to maintain the natural order has caused the world to respond. They now cry out for us to do something. In the province of [place_where_the_rebels_gonna_spawn.GetName], some of the most fervent have begun to raise arms."
 nan_events.17.a: "Stop them!"
 nan_events.17.b: "There is nothing we can do."
 nan_events.18.t: "Overwhelming Darkness"
 nan_events.18.d: "When one lives in the dark, they live without hope for success. During periods of darkness in Ñanliku nations, the citizenry does not look for opportunities for improvement. Instead they wallow. This rot spreads to every corner of society and makes every bond weak. Without strong bonds, the entire structure of the nation is bound to come crashing down. Our state currently finds itself in the midst of a period of darkness. [Root.Monarch.GetName] can barely lift a finger to impact change and restore the balance. The natural order of the world has been deeply disrupted, we must ensure that our actions from here on out bring us closer to Yanantin."
 nan_events.18.a: "Forever Crushed."
 nan_events.18.b: "We must find a way out!" 
 nan_events.19.t: "Lost Image"
 nan_events.19.d: "Forgetfulness is associated with a lack of light in Ñanliku society. During periods of darkness, the faithful are occupied with thoughts of despair and the hopelessness of their situation. They forget their daily tasks and their place in society. As our nation battles a lack of balance, the highest rungs of society have started to crumble. Bearactas, diplomats, and ministers have shirked their duties and poorly represented the interests of our people. If we continue down this course our nation will fall into obscurity. We must rally those who still have hope for the future to raise their arms and assert the authority of the natural order, before it is too late."
 nan_events.19.a: "We will be found once again."
 nan_events.19.b: "We are lost."
 nan_events.20.t: "From the Dark"
 nan_events.20.d: "Under the light of the moon, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to guide our nation through a period of dark. During such times of Ñanliku history, nations are prone to collapse and warfare. While we may have indulged in some of the latter, the efforts of our expert ruler have managed to avoid much of the former. For this reason, we have been granted a rare opportunity to make up lost ground and return back to proper Yanatin. Alternatively, we could exploit this current state of prosperity to build up our nation so that we may never again fall out of the natural order. Whatever our decision, let us enjoy the stability we now experience while we can."
 nan_events.20.a: "Return to the natural order."
 nan_events.20.b: "Exploit this development."
 nan_events.21.t: "Army Cloaked in Dusk"
 nan_events.21.d: "Ñanliku periods of darkness bring war. Without the light of day to reveal the evil wrought by violence, men are inclined to fight. We now find ourselves in this same hole, dug into a war against an enemy nation. As we struggle for victory, it would be wise to remember the past nations which have achieved success during their dark periods. We can learn from their past mistakes and shape our strategy towards victory. Perhaps, once this is all over, we can begin to return to the natural order. As it stands we must make a choice. What shall we learn from those that have come before?"
 nan_events.21.a: "Our men will bask in the night."
 nan_events.21.b: "Our cavalry will trample out the flames."
 nan_events.21.c: "The moon will shield us from harm."
 nan_events.21.e: "We will learn to live in the dark."
 nan_events.22.t: "Shadowy Payments"
 nan_events.22.d: "There is a misconception among outsiders of the faith pertaining to times of balance. Some believe that when our society reaches proper Yanantin all benefit, but this is not the case. During times of light, the citizenry enjoys much greater rights and lives in a happy state. During times of darkness, the unscrupulous are able to pull schemes and make a living. Balance only brings things to the correct order, the natural order. In the dark period we find ourselves in, many seedy figures have come out of the woodworks to make a quick buck. They offer our administration a lucrative opportunity. If we turn a blind eye to their business, they will give us a portion of their profits. Of course, the correct thing to do would be to break their operation and add some light to our Yanantin. However, with their funds we might be able to more effectively restore balance."
 nan_events.22.a: "Take the money."
 nan_events.22.b: "Balance above all."
 nan_events.23.t: "Puppetmasters"
 nan_events.23.d: "Relationships involve a level of clarity. While the father may put things in simpler terms to his child, he is never to lie to him. Such an action would not be according to the natural order. Similarly, it is important that the actions of the ruler be clear to their subjects. Without clarity, the relationship is invalidated. During periods of darkness, many Ñanliku nations experience a fundamental disconnect between their populace and ruler. The ruler retreats into the shadows and attempts to manipulate the aspects of the state through covert means. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has fallen prey to this temptation and begun to toy around with the different offices of government. While this will certainly not help in restoring the natural order, perhaps it can be used to our advantage. Through manipulating certain individuals, we increase the nation’s prosperity and set up our return to proper Yanantin."
 nan_events.23.a: "Improve our reputation."
 nan_events.23.b: "Grease a few palms."
 nan_events.23.c: "Hire extra talent."
 nan_events.23.e: "We will learn to live in the dark."
 nan_events.24.t: "In the Corners"
 nan_events.24.d: "Our nation has fallen far from its just order. This can be felt in the city streets, littered and unkempt by those who once cleaned with joy. Despite this, our dark period has not wholly diffused throughout our countryside. There are pockets of the land, though few and far between, where some have managed to maintain proper Yanantin. The actions of our state have angered these communities. Our infernal dark clouds loom over their paradise, threatening to topple what they have built at a moment’s notice. Some among the more militant of these groups have decided to take action. Slinking through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName], they made their way to the palace. With a hidden dagger, they waited for the arrival of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Heir.GetName]. Balance must be restored. Whatever the cost."
 nan_events.24.a: "Take my life."
 nan_events.24.b: "A Tragedy."
 nan_events.25.t: "Importance of Principles"
 nan_events.25.d: "Ñan features many rules passed down through the generations. Learned through centuries of wisdom, these rules help to ensure that future nations can maintain the natural order of the world and prevent the fall of man. Among the most important of the rules are “The Principles,” a set of five statements which have come to define Ñan. First, one must live by the natural order. Second, one must respect the fundamental relationships of the world and make no attempt to divorce either concept. Third, one must do all actions of light with an action of dark. Fourth, one must give thanks to those that came before and learn from them what they can. Fifth and finally, one must pass forward the lessons of the past lest man fall again. Time and time again, nations have forgotten these principles and been led astray by the alluring opposites. As we reflect on such things, let us choose a path forward which best represents the natural order."
 nan_events.25.a: "The promising light."
 nan_events.25.b: "The noble dark."
 nan_events.25.c: "No compromise."
 nan_events.25.e: "Balance above all."
 nan_events.26.t: "Made Whole"
 nan_events.26.d: "Through proper practice and the guidance of nature, our nation has managed to achieve a state of Yanantin. Many have tried and many have failed to accomplish this same task. Our subjects have become one with the earth, working in harmony with their environment. With a proper distance, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is able to rule on matters of the state and ensure prosperity for those below [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. We must enjoy this while it lasts. No period of balance lasts forever. Man is fundamentally capricious, through his agency he is doomed to ruin the world. However, with the right leadership, we might be able to maintain this harmony for a while longer and ease our nation into its next period of dark or light. Before we rush to such plans, let us take a moment to appreciate the beauty of a Yanantin state. Let us appreciate being made whole."
 nan_events.26.a: "True Yanantin."
 nan_events.26.b: "Maintain balance."
 nan_events.27.t: "Falling Apart"
 nan_events.27.d: "Stability for man cannot be found in the natural order. This is a lesson passed down from our ancestors. Man’s agency makes him capricious, able to buck against the natural order and make his own balance. The truth, what is right, can be found in the natural order. Even if a nation of man follows the natural order to a tee, it is bound to crumble. Yet, it is our duty to maintain the natural order, lest we upset the world itself. One day, man will learn how to match his ambitions with that of the world. Evidently, that day is not today. We have successfully aligned our nation with the natural order, however we have run into a patch of instability. During times such as these, many in our nation will abandon their given purpose and revert to the whims of light and dark."
 nan_events.27.a: "We seek comfort in the light."
 nan_events.27.b: "We seek comfort in the dark."
 nan_events.28.t: "Balanced Military"
 nan_events.28.d: "Though we upset the natural order through debasing ourselves to war, our current conflict could help to further the prosperity of our own nation. War is the business of man. Since our nation follows the natural order, we will have a key advantage of a balanced military. Our enemies will likely have no such luxury, disorganized and incongruent with the world. We must now decide how we wish to proceed. Should we focus on our victory in the moment or perhaps listen to the wisdom of the past? Whatever our choice, let us quickly be done with this nasty business of the war lest we disrupt the balance of our nation in a permanent manner."
 nan_events.28.a: "Live in the moment."
 nan_events.28.b: "Remember the lessons of the past."
 nan_events.29.t: "One with the World"
 nan_events.29.d: "While proper Yanantin brings no true prosperity to man, it improves the productivity of those who live under its grace. Oneness with the world brings with it a coordination with the flow of the natural order. Farmers who are one with the world are able to more easily till the earth and enjoy their labor. The balanced craftsman is able to cherish every good which he produces. The wondrous state of Yanantin our nation finds itself under continues to bless us in unpredictable ways. We now have the opportunity to seriously bolster a portion of our nation’s economy. Shall we choose to focus on the capital or take on a more nationwide focus?"
 nan_events.29.a: "[Root.Capital.GetName] is an example to all."
 nan_events.29.b: "We work in harmony."
 nan_events.30.t: "Perfect Balance"
 nan_events.30.d: "Ñan scholars identify three different levels of Yanantin, referred to as the three balances. The Low Balance exudes from communities which live along with the natural order by coincidence. Their lives happen to match up with aspects of the order which they continue to maintain. They are ignorant of the true nature of their actions. High Balance is achieved by communities that strive for and attain Yanantin. Through careful choices and years of effort, these groups can guide their nation to live under the natural order. This never lasts for long, as man’s capricious nature trends them towards light and dark. Perfect Balance is the third, and rarest, of the levels. It describes a community which has achieved Yanantin not through work, but through the wisdom of ancestors and guidance of the Gods. Our nation has managed to achieve such a level of oneness with the world that can only be described with this label. We now exist under the natural order of the universe, open to its swaying influence. Let us enjoy its embrace. Let us celebrate this victory. Let us, for the first time, truly live."
 nan_events.30.a: "Harmony with the world."
 nan_events.30.b: "Harmony with ourselves."
 nan_events.31.t: "Pacha"
 nan_events.31.d: "Ñan cosmology is split into three different realms: Hanan Pacha, Kay Pacha, and Ukhu Pacha. Hanan Pacha represents the realm above, where the Gods exist alongside the stars. The fundamental sources of light and dark are said to exist within Hanan Pacha. Kay Pacha is the realm we inhabit. Ukhu Pacha is the realm of life and death, the final resting place of all souls. Each of these realms has its own natural order which the beings within are subject to. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has spent many days pondering the nature of these realms. Through careful study, [Root.Monarch.GetHeShe] could gain insight into the particular wisdom of one of these realms and apply its knowledge to better the nation. After careful consideration [Root.Monarch.GetName] chose to study…"
 nan_events.31.a: "Hanan Pacha."
 nan_events.31.b: "Kay Pacha."
 nan_events.31.c: "Ukhu Pacha."
 nan_events.31.e: "Above All."
 nan_events.32.t: "Inti"
 nan_events.32.d: "Inti is the sun God of the Ñan. Alongside Mama Quilla, he represents one of the only deities of the faith. Inti controls the forces of light and has often meddled in the lives of pious Ñanliku. It is told in ancient stories that Inti was the source of man’s agency, given to him as an attempt to bolster the presence of light in Kay Pacha. Some believe that Inti himself may have agency over the realm of Hanan Pacha. Despite his prolific and giving nature, worship of Inti is often seen as a useless and unbalancing endeavor. The Gods work for their own interests rather than those of man, so there is no point to try and get their attention. We must still pay respect to those above us. Such is the natural order of this world."
 nan_events.32.a: "May he shine on our people."
 nan_events.32.b: "May he shine on our rule"
 nan_events.33.t: "Mama Quilla"
 nan_events.33.d: "Mama Quilla is the moon God of the Ñan. Alongside, Inti they represent the only deities of the faith. The influence of Mama Quilla can be seen among the dark. It is believed that Mama Quilla was the one to forge the sky, poking holes through the night to connect our worlds using a sewing needle. The moon is the most obvious symbol of Mama Quilla’s presence. It is believed to represent a portion of herself that she has placed into Kay Pacha as a way to light up the night. If not for her help, man would have fallen to the dark long ago. Despite her prolific and giving nature, worship of Mama Quilla is often seen as a useless and unbalancing endeavor. The Gods work for their own interests rather than those of man, so there is no point to try and get their attention. We must still pay respect to those above us. Such is the natural order of this world."
 nan_events.33.a: "She blesses our nation."

 nan_events.34.t: "Linh Authority"
 nan_events.34.d: "Understanding of the natural order is not uniform among all people. Some are given special insight into the world through their birth. The proclivity one has to understand the natural order is known as Linh. Those with high Linh are often revered among Ñanliku society due to their ability to maintain balance. Through extensive study, some of these gifted individuals are able to save entire nations from ruin. With all of this in mind, one can see that claiming to hold Linh authority can greatly boost one’s status. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has begun to make some questionable claims about [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to sense the natural order. Apparently, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has had this ability for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire rule. Some of the genuine Ñan scholars in our nation have begun to question the motives of our dear monarch. Perhaps we should clarify our claims."
 nan_events.34.a: "Claim if for ourselves."

 nan_events.35.t: "Words of the Future"
 nan_events.35.d: "The natural order is right. The natural order is steady. The combination of these two aspects makes the natural order predictable. One who has insight into the natural order can use it to see what is to come in the future. For centuries, those who are gifted in understanding the natural order, known as Linh authorities, have guided the lost by showing them the future. Such divination is greatly beneficial to the lives of men who wish to learn of their enemy’s moves and future prosperity. A renowned diviner has recently reached [Root.Capital.GetName] and offered her services to our court. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to…"

 nan_events.35.b: "Let the fates decide."
 nan_events.36.t: "Bodies of the Old"
 nan_events.36.d: "A common practice among the ancient Incas was mummification. Their dead rulers were to be preserved in order to keep their spirits from entering Ukha Pacha. The ancestor spirits would then help to guide the next generation in maintaining the natural order before being burned and allowed to move on. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has spoken to diviners across the nation who believe that our people are to face great difficulty in the future. For this reason [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has pondered if  [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] should take this step. With explicit instructions, [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s body would be mummified and preserved among the imperial dead. When guidance was needed, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could be called upon. Lingering over the idea, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decides that they will…"

 nan_events.37.d: "Sometimes it is useful to know that you are not alone when given an overwhelming task. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has struggled to maintain [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule over [Root.GetName] through trials and tribulations. In such tough times, many rulers find comfort in the words of those who have come before. One of our past rulers graciously prevented their movement to the next life through mummification in an attempt to preserve their wisdom. Through unearthing and communing with the ancestor spirit [Root.Monarch.GetName] was able to reach a greater peace. During the interaction [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] decided to…"
 nan_events.37.a: "Remember Them."
 nan_events.37.b: "Seek the ancient wisdom."
 nan_events.38.t: "Neidan"
 nan_events.38.d: "Some individuals are naturally gifted with an ability to understand the world. These people are said to have Linh authority, an honorable and sought after trait. However, some of the most prolific Ñanliku scholars have posited that one can achieve similar levels of Linh through a process known as Neidan. Through the repetition of dualistic rituals, a pious Ñanliku can attune themselves with the natural order. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has considered undergoing this type of internal alchemy in order to better serve [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people. Of course, such a process would take a long time and likely disrupt the flow of their focus for a period. However, after all was said and done, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could achieve a state of internal perfection."
 nan_events.38.a: "We will embark on the journey."
 will_will_probably_annoy_you_but_we_will_get.tt: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will embark on a journey to enlightenment through ritual meditation. We will be required to §RFREQUENTLY§! reflect on our internal state for §Yten years§!."
 nan_events.38.b: "Witchcraft!"
 nan_events.39.t: "Internal Alchemy"
 nan_events.39.d: "The grueling nature of Neidan is a necessary part of its practice. Just as the natural order is repetitive and dull to the capricious lives of men, one must repeat the dull actions of meditation and worship to reach a state of awareness. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has certainly struggled to maintain this practice. The repeated distractions and divisions in attention could very well impact [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule. Perhaps it is time to throw in the towel. We have sacrificed little except for our time to this fickle process. Who even knows if the final result is worth all of the effort?"
 nan_events.39.a: "Press Onwards."

 nan_events.40.t: "Enlightenment"
 nan_events.40.d: "After ten years of constant mediation, worship, and reflection [Root.Monarch.GetName] has finally achieved a oneness with the natural order. It is almost as if the world has opened up its mouth and spoken the secrets of life directly into [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s ears. With this grand new authority, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will no doubt prove to be an increasingly wise ruler. Many Linh scholars have already begun to arrive in [Root.Capital.GetName] to congratulate [Root.Monarch.GetName] on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wonderful accomplishment. With the natural order in our hearts, we will be able to face whatever challenges the world throws at us. Let us build a nation which can stand united with the world."
