 catholico_events.1.t: "The Sinful Crowd"
 catholico_events.1.d: "As the ruler of a pious Catholic nation, we are responsible for the spiritual well being of our citizens. We must act like a shepherd and gently guide our flock to their salvation. Across the countryside, a plague of heretical practices have begun to lead our herd astray. If left to fester, this rot will taint our nation’s very soul and further fracture the Catholic faith. We still have enough time to correct this mistake. With a firm hand, we can ensure that the proper rites are practiced across our nation. While this would certainly put pressure on some of our citizens, it might be the only way to hop off the terrible path that we find ourselves heading down."
 catholico_events.1.a: "Let them practice."
 catholico_events.1.b: "Shut them down!"
 catholico_events.2.t: "Love Thy Neighbor"
 catholico_events.2.d: "Despite the bloody nature of Catholicism’s expansion, the church has routinely called for peace amongst its members. The “Paz Eterna” of the 13th century saw few conflicts across the Mexican continent as the Tepeyac papacy extended its influence abroad. The influence of this century-long peace continues to linger in the minds of the faithful. Our recent conflict has brought us into contention with another powerful Catholic nation. Disrupting the peace in such a major way has upset many clergymen in our borders. They are now calling upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] to publicly express regret for this conflict and repent for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] great sin. Giving in to such a request would greatly disturb our position on the international stage, but might be necessary in order to repair the decaying influence of the Tepeyac papacy."
 catholico_events.2.a: "We decide when to stop!"
 catholico_events.2.b: "We'll face the consequences."
 catholico_events.3.t: "Repurposing Chapels."
 catholico_events.3.d: "Few rulers are willing to admit it, but the religious institutions of a nation can often be a burden. Currently, the clergy are tying up many of our nation’s resources into their untouchable grasp. Attempting to use any of these resources would likely draw the ire of other pious nations. However, some of the cleverest minds in our palace have thought up a solution to this problem. Through exploiting some of the chapels which we have personally funded using our treasury we can claw back some of what has been taken from us. Of course, we must also consider the possible long-term impacts of our exploitation. If we seriously damage the Catholic faith through our actions, the cost of rebuilding the faith may be far more costly."
 catholico_events.3.a: "Sell off some relics."
 catholico_events.3.b: "Put the priests to work."
 catholico_events.3.c: "Tax the clergy."
 catholico_events.3.e: "Let them continue their practice."
 catholico_events.4.t: "Grip of the Church"
 catholico_events.4.d: "Catholicism is the faith of our people and, barring any dire circumstances, will continue to remain dominant in our nation for generations. This continuity served the ancient Catholics well, providing a gentle reassurance of the life ahead. Yet this continuity also entrenches the church within our nation. This fact has proved routinely troublesome for our administration as we attempt to maintain our sovereignty. Keeping the clergy so close to our process of government has clouded [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s judgment and damaged our ability to rule. This has pushed us into a tight spot. By taking action against the clergy, we will damage the standing of the Catholic church. However, having the church dominate our monarch will undoubtedly lead to unstable times."
 catholico_events.4.a: "Edge them out of government."
 catholico_events.4.b: "Let them reign."
 catholico_events.5.t: "Lord of Lords"
 catholico_events.5.d: "During the ancient days of the Catholic church, the Papal See and Catholic world were one unit. There were no followers of the Tepeyac papacy outside of Mexico City. The Pope held absolute authority over the faithful and guided them in matters of state alongside religion. As the faith expanded, the roles of kings and popes were continuously challenged by different nations. The notion of the “Heavenly Servet” prevailed among the citizenry. Under this title, the monarch ruled as a chosen servant of God who was just as fallible to sin as his citizens. Into the Golden Age of Mexico, this doctrine promoted peace between kings and popes. Over the generations, this notion was questioned by the various Catholic rulers. In our modern day, the notion still lives on, but with a particular air of skepticism. Grandiose notions of divine selection are more commonplace among Catholic monarchs. [Root.Monarch.GetName] certainly feels more inspired than those in the past. Who would question that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was selected by the heavens above?"
 catholico_events.5.a: "We are all knowing."
 catholico_events.5.b: "Our mercy lasts forever."
 catholico_events.5.c: "We are all mighty."
 catholico_events.5.e: "We are eternally devout."
 catholico_events.6.t: "Heathen Friends"
 catholico_events.6.d: "Fearing the amassing hordes of cultists and heretics surrounding Mexico City, the first Tepeyac pope Boniface II shut the gates of the city and prevented entry to all nonCatholics. For almost four years, the city was completely isolated. For centuries after, the papacy took on a noncompliant attitude towards their heretic and heathen neighbors. Technologically backwards and isolated, it was only the ancient city’s walls which kept the Holy See untarnished. This all changed when, with cooperation with the early patriotic hordes and Mayans in the south, the papacy was able to thrive during the Middle Ages. With the hindsight of history, the papacy’s decision to isolate itself seems to be a foolish mistake, yet the current dogma actively discourages heathen alliances. Our decision to reach out to our ungodly neighbors is just the first step in disrupting this idiodic policy. If it damages the reputation of the church, so be it."
 catholico_events.6.a: "Hate the sin, love the sinner."
 catholico_events.7.t: "A Bishop in Need"
 catholico_events.7.d: "Bishops form the backbone of the Catholic faith. From their administrative heights, they command the appointment of priests and report to Tepeyac. Throughout the ages, bishops have routinely served as a middleman between pope and king. Their guiding influence has ensured peace and prosperity throughout the Catholic world. It is with the pains of our more critical time that these once appreciated men have been cast aside and forced to labor. One of the bishops in our own nation has fallen on hard times and is seeing no support from the wider Catholic church. Some among our administration have suggested that we use a portion of our royal funds to ease his burden, while others have contested that this would only excuse the See’s inaction."
 catholico_events.7.a: "Assist Him!"
 catholico_events.7.b: "The church will sort him out."
 catholico_events.8.t: "Corrupt Purity"
 catholico_events.8.d: "To bear false witness is a grave sin. While [Root.Monarch.GetName] is free from error, members of our nation’s administration have begun to take on bribes and rule unfairly. Through tolerating this corruption, we lie to our own people. A nation built upon sin will surely fall. In times such as these, it is wise to reach out to the clergy and ask for their assistance. With the help of the church, we can route out these corrupt bureaucrats and ensure that our nation remains pure. However, partnering with the church in this way will grant legitimacy to the Tepeyac See."
 catholico_events.8.a: "We are pure under his light."
 catholico_events.8.b: "We will cure our own ills."
 catholico_events.9.t: "Cathedral Expansion"
 catholico_events.9.d: "In the province of [cool_temple_video_thing.GetName], we have constructed a great temple. This structure serves as an anchor for the community and a place of reflection for the faithful. However, the faithful of [cool_temple_video_thing.GetName] have begun to outgrow the cathedral’s small size and now long for a larger place to worship. A larger cathedral would allow for a more pliable and subservient community. While many of our advisors were initially against the construction due to its predicted price, the clergy of [cool_temple_video_thing.GetName] have reached out in order to help facilitate the process. Working with these charitable sorts would undoubtedly ease our part of the financial burden, but give legitimacy to the church."
 catholico_events.9.a: "Fund their request."
 catholico_events.9.b: "Ignore their please."
 catholico_events.10.t: "Rigid Devotion"
 catholico_events.10.d: "Taking on a theologically inclined advisor has created some interesting opportunities for our state. Most Catholic rulers have relied upon the advice of their nation’s bishops and priests for religious matters rather than anyone outside of the church’s grasp. We now have the luxury of listening to both. However, we must now decide which of the two we will allow to reside in our court. Having both would likely mire the court in disputes and unproductivity. By keeping our advisor we would likely have a more impartial view on different religious matters which would greatly benefit our state. Conversely, if we chose the clergymen we will likely bolster the status of the church and have more direct contact with The Holy See."
 catholico_events.10.a: "Secular Advice."
 catholico_events.10.b: "We listen to the church alone."
 catholico_events.11.t: "Model Catholics"
 catholico_events.11.d: "Our commitment to spreading Catholicism has paid off in forming a religiously devout state. Across our country, nearly every citizen piously observes the commandments and gives lavishly to the church. We have done well in this respect and garnered praise from the Holy See itself. As a shining example to all other Catholic nations, we have greatly increased the status of the church and paved the way for further conversions. Let us take a moment to relish in our accomplishment and thank the Almighty for giving us this opportunity."
 catholico_events.11.a: "Wonderful"
 catholico_events.12.t: "Reaching out to [ally_who_is_getting_catholiced.GetName]"
 catholico_events.12.d: "Heretics have always troubled the Catholic church. In the years after the flood, there were many who claimed to hold apostolic succession from the church of Peter. In the dark ages, the church was surrounded by Mexican Evangelicals whose worship bordered on heresy. Yet, during these times, heretics often served as crucial allies for the church against heathen hordes. Our ally of [ally_who_is_getting_catholiced.GetName] is of the heretic sort, but some have suggested that they are open to conversion. Many in our administration have suggested that we reach out to [pally_who_is_getting_catholiced.Monarch.GetName] and make the case for their acceptance of the Catholic faith. If we are able to sway them through our words, we will undoubtedly strengthen the position of the church and increase the connection between our nations. On the other hand, failure will likely strain our relationship and damage the reputation of the church."
 catholico_events.12.a: "They must be brought to the true faith."
 catholico_events.12.b: "We will let them practice."
 explain_what_reaching_out_will_do_cool.tt: "We will reach out to [ally_who_is_getting_catholiced.GetName] and offer them the oppertunity to convert to the Catholic faith. If they agree, we will gain the following modifier: "
 catholico_events.13.t: "The Catholic Request"
 catholico_events.13.d: "From our allies in [From.GetName] we have received a strange request. A small procession featuring [From.Monarch.GetName] arrived at our court and requested that we convert to the Catholic faith. While our nation is built on an antipapal policy, some in our administration have suggested that we go forward and accept their offer. The Catholic world is full of potential allies and justifications for expansion. While changing course now will undoubtedly be tough for our nation, it might just be the thing we need in order to thrive. Let us carefully consider our next moves and choose the action which will best preserve our nation and deliver prosperity unto our people."
 catholico_events.13.a: "A foolish idea."
 catholico_events.13.b: "Perhaps they are right."
 catholico_events.14.t: "The Heretic Sort"
 catholico_events.14.d: "The response from [From.GetName] has arrived and delivered disappointment to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. In a gently worded letter, the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has rejected our proposal for [Root.Get.HerHis] conversion while trying to reaffirm our alliance. Our damaging gambit has no doubt troubled relations between our nation. Hopefully they can recover, in time."
 catholico_events.14.a: "Fools!"
 catholico_events.15.t: "A Stronger Faith"
 catholico_events.15.d: "The response from [From.GetName] has proved extremely favorable. In a triumphant letter, the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has proclaimed [Root.Get.HerHis] devotion to the Tepeyac papacy. This unexpected outcome has greatly strengthened our relations and drawn the eye of His Eminence. With official recognition we have been branded a “Holy Negotiator” by the See, let us carry this reputation with pride."
 catholico_events.15.a: "Wonderful!"
 catholico_events.16.t: "Luring a Cardinal"
 catholico_events.16.d: "Cardinals provide useful access to the Holy See. Through hosting a Cardinal within our state, we can influence their actions and, by extension, influence the election of new popes. In the same vein, more cardinals give greater access and more influence on the See. Right across our border, the cardinal of [place_where_cardinal_will_be_lured_from.GetName] has extended an offer to our nation. For a price, he will cross the border in order to reside in our nation and officially support our administration. While this would undoubtedly damage the reputation of the church and vastly increase the corruption within our nation, it would also give us crucial access to the papacy. We should carefully consider our next actions, lest we ensure our eternal damnation."
 catholico_events.16.a: "If he's offering..."
 catholico_events.16.b: "The church needs to be cleaned!"
 catholico_events.17.t: "Loss of a Cardinal"
 catholico_events.17.d: "The scoundrels of [From.GetName] convinced a cardinal in our nation to abandon us. Through underhanded bribes and all manner of trickery, they have lured the holy man to travel across the border and join their cause. Cardinals are crucial for managing our influence over the papacy. The loss of this cardinal is something we should not forget. Let all those sinners in [From.GetName] be afraid of our might. We will get our retribution, in time."
 catholico_events.17.a: "Damn them!"
 catholico_events.18.t: "Thumb on the Scale"
 catholico_events.18.d: "By possessing a cardinal within our nation, we are granted unique access to the Holy See. Through influencing the actions of this cardinal, we can influence the actions of the papacy. Some of the seedier individuals in our administration have suggested that we cut some deals with a cardinal in order to get closer access to the papacy. Having our usury forgiven or wars greenlit would be greatly worth the potential corruption. The only true question is whether we could commit such a great sin. Let us carefully consider the divine ramifications of influencing a holy man. A few more years in purgatory might just be worth the success in this life."
 catholico_events.18.a: "A more personal audience."
 catholico_events.18.b: "How far the church has fallen."
 catholico_events.19.t: "Heretics Target Cardinal"
 catholico_events.19.d: "Heretics within our nation have begun to take radical efforts in order to damage our faith. Cardinals are crucial for our nation as they provide us with personal influence in the Holy See. Heretics have begun to make threats against our cardinals for this reason, seeing their influence as emblematic of the problems with the Catholic faith. Some in our administration have begun to take their threats credibly and have urged us to better defend the cardinal. Others have simply stated that this is a scare tactic, made to exhaust our nation’s resources. The final decision falls to us, we must decide on a course of action which will best preserve our resources and ensure victory in this battle for our faith."
 catholico_events.19.a: "We will increase defense"
 catholico_events.19.b: "They wouldn't dare"
 nothing_will_happen.tt: "Nothing"
 catholico_events.20.t: "Death of a Cardinal"
 catholico_events.20.d: "Through unfortunate circumstances, the cardinal of [place_where_cardinal_dies.GetName] has fallen at the hands of a heretic mob. The threats made against the cardinal turned out to be true, as the heretics descended on [place_where_cardinal_dies.GetName] like a swarm of locusts. Murdered, chopped up, and displayed in pieces in the town square; this was no fate for a holy man. Across our nation, pious citizens have begun to mourne. Let us take a moment to reflect before we respond with righteous anger and remember this loss. Hopefully, we will never make such a mistake again."
 catholico_events.20.a: "We will mourne."
 catholico_events.21.t: "Grave News from [From.GetName]"
 catholico_events.21.d: "Within the nation of [From.GetName] a cardinal has been murdered by a heretic mob. The grisly scene saw the heretics butcher and display the scattered corpse of the cardinal around the town square. The utter brutality of these heretics surprised many members of the public and has shined a light on some of our incompetencies. Our inability to protect holy men has led many to abandon their posts out of fear. With heretics ruling the lives of pious citizens, a great blow has been dealt to our church’s reputation. Hopefully we can recover some credibility in time."
 catholico_events.21.a: "These heretics will pay!"
 catholico_events.22.t: "Home in Tepeyec"
 catholico_events.22.d: "Mexico city is the home of the Tepeyac papacy. On the great hill, Juan Diego saw the Virgin Guadalupe. Centuries later, after the flood, the Virgin Guadalupe appeared to Boniface III and encouraged him to take on the title of Pope. For this reason, the city has remained an incredibly important site for the Catholic faith. Our conquest of the city has proved to be troublesome for our nation, as others have begun to look at us with disapproving faces. To them, we are divinely compelled to give the city over to the papacy. Yet, nowhere in the bible or the catechism does it say that the papacy must reign over it. Keeping the city would likely draw the ire of our more pious citizens and inspire unrest, but they will get over it in time. Let us take a moment and carefully consider our position moving forward before choosing any action."
 catholico_events.22.a: "It is his city."
 catholico_events.22.b: "He should focus on the heavens."
 we_will_get_events_related_to_the_tepeyac_papacy.tt: "We will recieve events intended for §YEstados Pontificios§!"
 catholico_events.23.t: "A Pope Without a State"
 catholico_events.23.d: "Our action to take Tepeyac has started a chain reaction that has resulted in the total decline of the Estados Pontificios. Through either losing wars or falling to rebellion, the Papacy no longer holds any political territory. Without a state, the papacy has undoubtedly lost much of its influence over the Catholic world. This is not the end of the faith, the papacy has survived worse. During the early days of the church, Mexico city was shattered between different heathen groups. It was only with the pious resolve of a few Catholics that the city was united. Some other nations will accept the papacy into open arms and give them a place to roost. This will not undo the damage of their lost territory, but will begin the road to recovery. Let us remember this hope as we venture into these dark times."
 catholico_events.23.a: "Oh no! Anyway."
 catholico_events.24.t: "Home Away From Home"
 catholico_events.24.d: "We have been approached by the holy father with a request for a province to inhabit. After the conquest of Mexico City and the rest of the papal lands, the Holy See has been left adrift. Directionless, they have lost much of their credibility. As a Catholic nation, we rely upon this credibility in order to function. Many pious citizens of our nation have lost interest in the faith and become directionless in their own lives. By allowing the papacy to reside in one of our provinces, we can hold onto the hope of restoring their credibility. Some in our administration have suggested the opposite, that we simply let another Catholic nation give away a piece of their land. Whatever our choice, let us take into account what the heavens above would prefer."
 catholico_events.24.a: "We will give him [province_which_the_pope_is_trynna_settle_on.GetName]."
 catholico_events.24.b: "It is not our burden."
 catholico_events.25.t: "A Godless World"
 catholico_events.25.d: "After attempting to contact the Catholic nations of the world, the papacy has returned to Mexico City empty handed. We welcomed them back with open arms, but without a state it feels bittersweet. A Catholic world without the political presence of the papacy will no doubt be more susceptible to sin and all manner of heresy. Hopefully, the resolve of Catholic leaders is enough to ensure that their citizens remain devout. A millennia of status quo has finally come to an end. This new secular age will have its challenges, but perhaps it is for the best. Through our refusal to hand over Mexico City, we have undeniably changed the course of this continent’s history. As we move forward into this new age, let us take a moment and reflect on the lessons of the past. Perhaps there is something to be gleaned from the centuries of history which we have forever altered."
 catholico_events.25.a: "Horror!"
 catholico_events.26.t: "Papal Revival"
 catholico_events.26.d: "Whether through revolution or the actions of a benevolent Catholic ruler, the papacy has been restored to its rightful political existence after its collapse. For years, the papacy lost its once powerful authority without a state. With its rise to prominence, there is once again hope for a united Catholic faith.  Just as in the past, those who held onto their faith were rewarded. In its absence, the Catholic world has fallen to heresy and degeneration as the rulers were left unchallenged. It is our job to work together with our Catholic allies and rebuild the faith. Let pray for this new papacy, may they lead us into a new age of light."
 catholico_events.26.a: "Interesting."
 catholico_events.27.t: "War for the Catholic Faith"
 catholico_events.27.d: "As a Catholic nation, we have committed a serious taboo in declaring war against the Estados Pontificios. While there is no scriptural basis for the papacy’s political existence, it has unanimously been declared sacred by the different Catholic nations of the world. It is important to remember this, as the papacy will likely receive support from abroad in this conflict. Though unlikely to directly involve themselves, other Catholic nations will likely send financial and political support to the papal states in order to ensure their victory. This means we will be facing an uphill battle. Let us take a moment to consider our position and decide the best path forward. We must harden our hearts, for God is the true judge."

 catholico_events.28.t: "The Brutes of [From.GetName]"
 catholico_events.28.d: "We have received news that [From.GetName] has declared war against the Estados Pontificios. While not directly stated in scripture, the political existence of the papacy has become an accepted norm of the Catholic world. With the pope’s political power, he can keep kings in check and prevent moral degradation. With this unprecedented and abhorrent move, [From.GetName] has stirred the Catholic world into action. Many kings from across the land have begun to give away lavishly to assist the papacy and ensure their victory. Some in our own administration have suggested that we donate some of our own political and financial resources in order to assist them. Our citizens now cry out for us to take a side, let us consider our next move carefully."

 catholico_events.29.d: "Our nation has been attacked by the brutes of [From.GetName]. As the political representatives of The Lord’s will, we are blessed with a special status amongst our Catholic colleagues. Any nation which attacks us is viewed negatively by the Cahtolic world. In addition, attacks on our nation spurr monarchs into delivering support. Once news reaches their courts of our situation, they will undoubtedly give untold amounts of financial and political aid.

When papal authority runs low, pious citizens begin to question their faith and heresy burns bright. Usually, some brave pope or curia controller takes this opportunity to restore the papacy’s authority and leave a lasting influence on the church. We are now graced with this opportunity. Restoring faith in the papacy will be no easy task, requiring our nation to divide its attention between the process of governing and affirming the faith. This will certainly task one portion of our monarch’s attention, the only remaining question is which portion should that be?"

Similarly, when papal authority begins to wane, our own nation may begin to decline. We are now in a period of strong papal control. This has reflected in our own nation, as our subjects begin to view our administration in a more favorable light as the curia controller. Our missionaries are far more zealous, deriving their inspiration from our legendary status. It is our duty to not abuse this power and to preserve the papacy’s legitimacy into ages beyond.

A joint coalition of church officials and our own administration’s experts gathered in [Root.Capital.GetName] in order to give [Root.Monarch.GetName] some guidance on the situation. Their solution entailed the expansion of church activities across the Catholic world led by our administration’s clergy. The plan would not come cheap, requiring us to spend a lot of political will in order to mobilize the right parts of government. However, when all was said and done, most of the Catholic world would be better prepared to fight against the fires of reformation.

Our vast army and competent administration will continue to ward off any challengers. These facts have provided our tenure as curia controller a special status different from our predecessors. Specifically, our administration is much more closely tied to the Holy See in both influence and authority.

 catholico_events.36.d: "The perception of the papacy’s authority is vital for our nation’s citizens. If the pope is believed to be corrupted or wholly fallible, their faith falls apart. Recent years have struck the papacy hard and caused an overall decline in authority. Bishops have begun to renounce the papacy and declare their own separate conclaves. In a time of such chaos, many of our citizens have simply opted to give up and relinquish their faith. While not explicitly secular, these new Vacandists believe that the pope of Tepeyac is illegitimate and that the See is vacant. While our administration still remains steadfast to our Catholic beliefs, local rulers in [citizens_lose_faith_prov_targ.GetName] have fully embraced the new Vacandist faith.

No doubt in league with the latin devils, these lords spread their new faith to their very own citizens. Now the whole province of [romanismo_target_prov_catlo.GetName] is denying the legitimacy of the Tepeyac papacy. While this is troubling in and of itself, the presence of Roman corruption in our territory points to a deeper problem in our administration. Any member of our royal court may be in league with these heretics. We must investigate all members of our nation and snuff out this heresy before it spreads any further."

 catholico_events.38.d: "Our Colombian neighbors have fallen to the influence of magi and devils as they corrupt our once pure countrymen. The occult plotting of a few wayward bishops has blossomed into the Sagrado faith which has come to rock our corner of the map. With their dark magics, the Sagradistas have corrupted the moral fiber of our nation and made the faithful pliable to their evil ideology. While they deny our claims of evil spells and mystical happenings, all true Catholics know of their devilish deeds. We must ensure that our people are resistant to their spiritual influence, only then will the lost souls of [mystical_target_prov_catlo_one.GetName] be able to join us once again in the light."

 catholico_events.39.d: "The greedy Mendozans of Empresia have spread their ideology of avarice to our nation’s borders and made our own citizens into crazed hoarders. Hoping to cut down on their mandatory tithe, some of the lords in our nation have threatened to convert to the Cruzite faith. The clergy needs those tithes in order to exert their influence and fight the tide of heresy we now experience. By paying their tithes for them, we could dissuade conversion and keep our nation whole. However, some in our administration have pointed out that this sets a dangerous precedent. Who is to say that next time these lords are pinched for tithes they won’t go ahead and attempt another stunt like this."

From the once great cities of Isthmo, their fire of reformist thought spread without regard for faith. Their dogma of deist thought and individualism is antithetical to the church’s teachings. Despite all of this, their lazy approach to religion has become popular amongst our people. No doubt they are simply confused by the big words and abstract lies told by these swindlers. We must come up with a plan of rebuttal in order to regain their trust and make our nation pure once again."
 catholico_events.40.a: "Horror!"
 catholico_events.41.t: "Resurgence of Belief"
 catholico_events.41.d: "In the ashes of belief, embers of the old Catholic faith still linger. Some of our citizens have abandoned the Tepeyac papacy in favor of local bishop conclaves. These Vacandists have served as a problem for our administration, disrupting our religious unity. However, over the past few years, many have returned to the Catholic faith due to the resurgence of papal authority. In the province of [vacandist_prov_to_target.GetName], the once solemn Vacandists have rejected their local beliefs and turned their eyes back to Tepeyac. We can only hope that others who have lost their way return in the same way as these enlightened souls."

 catholico_events.42.d: "Our nation now faces a threat which could cause its disillusion: heresy. For centuries, the Catholic World has remained whole under the guidance of the Tepeyac papacy. The children born over these centuries have grown progressively more complacent and disillusioned with Tepeyac’s authority. Without the guidance of a strong willed papacy, they have fractured our faith into all manner of heretical and seedy practices. As a pious ruler, it is our job to correct this behavior and crush those who are not willing to negotiate. A strict policy of firm resistance will surely teach those heretics why the papacy has survived so long."

Our nation holds a direct line to the papacy in the form of one of these cardinals who has proved instrumental in resisting this reformation. From his learned position, the cardinal has debunked many heretic lies and convinced entire towns to change their minds on matters of the faith. Just now, the once heretic province of [prov_for_cardinal_conversion.GetName] has been converted through his diligent work. With the tenacity of folks like this cardinal, the Catholic faith will surly whether this storm and continue to remain pure for centuries."

 catholico_events.44.d: "The heretics that now threaten our nation’s borders are branching out their crooked ideology. The farthest reaches of our nation, our colonies beyond the sea, are a hotbed for new ideas. While we have mostly managed to protect them from these heretics, some have begun to board ships and evangelize. Unusually, some in our administration have suggested that we do not attempt to restrain their efforts. Having these heretics spread across the waves may make it easier to snuff out their fervor in the homeland. Their extra manpower on the frontier will greatly increase the rate that our colonies are able to settle. Conversely, some of our advisors have suggested that their efforts overseas will be much more impactful and possibly cause an outright conversion of the colony. Such a difficult decision cannot be taken lightly, may The Lord give us guidance to make the right choice."

Many of these heretics have been outcast from their communities and opt to make new lives across the waves. While this has provided our colony with the benefits of additional manpower, it has led to trouble as they begin to evangelize to our own faithful citizens. Through the actions of these settlers, many of our own citizens have come to embrace a crooked form of the Catholic faith and now demand that we embrace it as well. While most of our administration has remained pure, some have suggested that we must join the heretics in order to survive. Without unity, our colony will fall to fractionalization and become easy pickings for the savages of this new world."

 catholico_events.46.d: "Catholicism was not always so rigid as it is today. At one time, all manner of heretical and folk beliefs saw their practice right alongside the traditional rites. Among the most enduring elements of this time is Santa Muerte. Emerging from the embers of the pre-Flood faith, Santa Muerte is most generally venerated as a folk saint who serves as an icon of death. Prayers to Santa Muerte are said to aid in healing or in quiet deaths. While the veneration of Santa Muerte has been routinely denounced by the Tepeyac papacy, many in our nation still continue to venerate her image. Some of our citizens have taken to the streets in order to celebrate and worship her influence. If we are to take action against this heretical practice, now would be the perfect opportunity."

The ancient legacy of this goal emerges from the early days of the church, where priests maintained pre-flood literature and spread it throughout Mexico city. Over time, more priests were raised to preserve these ancient tales and teach future generations. Our nation is no stranger to scholarship, yet we could always use more assistance in training future generations. Members of our clergy have contacted our administration and offered a partnership between the church and some of our institutions. If we grant these clergymen a few plots of land, they will build robust Catholic schooling. While the curriculum will be decided by the church, these facilities would undoubtedly be havens for future scholars."

After an intense study of the natural world, one of our court scholars has made a discovery which goes against the teachings of the church. Due to our partnership, many of our nation’s top officials have been educated to doubt this discovery and discredit its results. Further study is required to confirm our court scholar’s findings. If we were to greenlight this study, it would upset many of our nation’s most educated citizens and be seen as a heretical action. On the other hand, if we deny further study we could hamper the scientific progress of our nation."

The innovations inspired by their education have vastly improved the lives of our citizens. Some members of our nation’s clergy have approached our administration with a plan for expansion. Under their guidance, some of these church facilities would be opened to the general public for their education as well. While this would work to create a more educated populace, it would also likely further entrench the church into the function of our nation. Discoveries which could be life changing for our citizens may be suppressed due to the dogma of the church. We must carefully consider what could come of this partnership before going forward."

The very hill that the papacy is based on, Tepeyac, was the site where Juan Diego saw Our Lady Guadalupe. To this very day, his tilma resides upon the hill. Many rulers have claimed to see The Virgin after battle or right before their deaths. Her guiding influence has led the faith to sublime heights. In her absence, the faith has fallen to some of its lowest troughs. We must remember this and give thanks to Our Lady. Let us consider her grace, the grace of The Lord, and pray for his protection of our nation, our people, our souls."

 catholico_events.51.d: "In a gracious gesture, the papacy has allowed our nation to leverage a tax on the churches of the land. Through taking a portion of these churches’ tithes, our administration has been able to collect the funds that we need to complete many projects. Recently, one of these churches has found itself fat with cash due to a number of wealthy donors.

 catholico_events.52.d: "The papacy has recently granted us the temporary ability to tax the churches of the land. By taking a portion of their tithes, our administration can obtain the funds that it needs to complete many of its ambitious projects. Every church in our nation donates amounts depending on their total income, yet some of them require all that they earn to stay afloat. Several of these churches have opted to donate some local artifacts to our administration in exchange for their required tithes. Varying in age, beauty, and value, these relics all have their own story. Now that they are in our possession, let us use them for a purpose that will exalt some aspect of our state. Whether that be our administration, the Catholic faith, or even our own royal coffers is up to us to decide."

 catholico_events.53.d: "Often, it isn’t poor financial management which can sink a nation’s economy, but the avoidance of financial taboos. If our nation were to engage in usury without a papal decree, many of our citizens would raise arms over the immorality of our ruler. However, with a special letter from Tepeyac, we have sidestepped this grim fate and can now operate in a lucrative way. Members of our nation’s wealthier classes have even offered to lend our administration money for its various aims. Such competitive loans are a valuable opportunity for our nation’s economy, let us seriously consider what could be done with the money."
 catholico_events.53.a: "We could use the money"
 catholico_events.53.b: "We have no need"
 catholico_events.54.t: "Papal Purity"
 catholico_events.54.d: "Throughout the history of the Catholic world, clergymen have been routinely relied upon for their morality. When warring rulers would finally decide to make peace, a nation’s bishops would often speak together in order to make sure both sides received what was fair. Further, clergymen were relied upon to ensure that financial transitions were legitimate. During the height of the crusades, many Catholic rulers traveled with a gaggle of clergymen for the sole reason of negotiation with other crusader kings. Our nation has recently been granted a papal pardon for the practice of usury, which has legitimized our practices and moved the fair eye of the clergy into our dealings. With their guidance, our administration will no doubt become a much purer institution."

 catholico_events.55.d: "From the mouthpiece of The Lord, our ruler has received an official church blessing. This divine legitimacy has emboldened many in our administration to strike back at the heretics that now assail us. In the province of [province_to_convert_divine_might_catlo.GetName], the arrogant and heretical local lords have poisoned the local folk into believing in their crooked outlook. As a divinely guided ruler, it is our job to crush these lords and ensure that our own citizens are returned to the right faith. Yet, perhaps it would be better to wait and allow the clergymen to attempt their own practice before we involve ourselves. Whatever path we choose, these heretics must be made to repent for their sins."

Through navigating the channels of papal influence, we have managed to get an official blessing for our ruler. Acting as both a powerful general and warden of the faith, our citizens have come to appreciate [Root.Monarch.GetName] as a leading figure in this war.

Throughout this conflict we have relied upon the guidance of the holy [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetName].

With this holyman’s guidance, our nation will be able to assert itself on the international stage like no other. Through simple suggestions and negotiations, we can change the legate’s message to fit our administration’s whims. In one man we have the potential to spread a message of cooperation with the papacy, the purity of our nation, or the excellence of our citizenry.
