 inua_events.1.t: "Angakkuq Offers Assistance"
 inua_events.1.d: "Within Inua societies, angakkuq tow the lines between the seen and unseen worlds. They commune with spirits and use this connection for the betterment of their community. It is for this reason that angakkuq are held in high regard by many pious Inuans. In our own realm, some Inuan communities look to their angakkuq with more reverence than our own ruler. Recently, we have received an offer from a prominent angakkuq who wishes to assist us in the task of governance. If we were to accept their offer, it is likely that they will greatly assist us in our own reign. On the other hand, their presence in the capital might sap talent away from their community. Regardless of where this angakkuq might fit best, we could always use this offer as an opportunity to publicly denounce their heathen practices and enforce our religious will."
 inua_events.1.a: "We are greatful."
 inua_events.1.b: "They will better serve their community."
 inua_events.1.c: "Heathens!"
 inua_events.2.t: "The Inua Faith"
 inua_events.2.d: "We are now at a pivotal crossroads for our nation as we consider what to do with our rising Inuan population. Despite its critical state at the start of the 15th century, the Inuan religion has managed to resurface and convert new masses. This has begun to pose a problem for our realm, as our population becomes fractured into different religious groups. Our advisors have collected themselves and proposed two different solutions to this grave issue. We could choose to accept the Inuans and allow them to practice their own religious beliefs. While this option would likely lead to a more docile populace, it would still lead to nationwide dysfunction from a lack of religious agreement. On the other hand, we could crack down on their beliefs and enforce conversion. This would greatly anger their populace, but in a few generations would eliminate their impact on our administration. While this is the advice of our learned advisors, there is always the option that we fully embrace the religion ourselves."
 inua_events.2.a: "We will accept them."
 inua_events.2.b: "They are Heathens!"
 inua_events.2.c: "Perhaps they are right..."
 inua_converting_faith.tt: "Every Inua Province gets: "
 inua_events.3.t: "Inua Object to Conflict"
 inua_events.3.d: "The Inua population of our realm are once again causing problems, this time due to our current state of war. Inuans utterly detest warfare for its unanimous destruction. Unlike other more warlike religions, Inuans see no value or righteousness in combat. It is this bit of doctrine that has led them to resist our administration’s orders at the worst time. The Inuans have demanded that we exempt them from the bloodshed and not force any of their sons to fight on behalf of our cause. Obviously, this flagrant act of defiance should be met with a strict punishment. However, this may not be possible given our military’s current preoccupation. Whatever our response, we must act decisively to ensure that we can continue to sustain our war effort."
 inua_events.3.a: "We can do nothing"
 inua_events.3.b: "Force them to serve"
 inua_events.4.t: "Inua Offer Amulet"
 inua_events.4.d: "Negotiation with spirits is a dangerous game. For generations, the Inua have developed methods which allow them to communicate and live in accordance with the laws of the spiritual world. Whatever our opinion is on the validity of these matters, it is obvious that they are incredibly important to our Inuan subjects. A procession of spiritual mediators, called angakkuq, have traveled to our capital in order to offer our ruler an amulet of protection. Amulets such as these commune with the spirits of the world and give guidance for their avoidance. Our reaction to this offer could go far in signaling our position on the legitimacy of the Inuan faith. Let us plan out our next moves wisely."
 inua_events.4.a: "We Accept their gifts."
 inua_events.4.b: "Witchcraft!"
 inua_events.5.t: "Merchants Disrupt Inua Trappers"
 inua_events.5.d: "Many Inua in the arctic rely upon furs in order to make their living. Selling them to outside buyers allows them to earn a hefty income which funds their lavish lifestyles. Recently, a conflict has arisen around these furs that requires our attention. One of our own citizens has infringed upon the traditional trapping lands of the Inua, which they claim hold religious significance. While typically this type of dispute would fall to some lower lord to manage, no one party can manage to achieve a compromise. Even though it is obvious that the land belongs to the Inua due to their ancestral heritage, we could rule against them and consolidate the territory for ourselves. The potential funds raised from such an action could fill our royal coffers to sublime peaks."
 inua_events.5.a: "It is their land."
 inua_events.5.b: "They are using it wrong."
 inua_events.6.t: "Senseless Slaughter"
 inua_events.6.d: "War is unforgivable. Through bringing conflict to our people, we have done a great dishonor to them. War disrupts the natural laws of the world and shortens the lives of those who commit its misdeeds. By forcing our own sons and daughters to be a part of this conflict, we have in turn shortened their own lives. This leaves a grim picture for our future generations, let us hope that they can come to forgive us in time."
 inua_events.6.a: "It was a necessity."
 inua_events.7.t: "Carving a New Future"
 inua_events.7.d: "Inua carvings serve a dual purpose as religious amulets and creative expressions. Just as the collectivists brand their goods with pictures of Stalin, the Inuans believe that their carvings can serve as guides among the unseen. Carvings blessed by special spiritual mediators, called angakkuq, serve as especially potent amulets. Among our own populace, an upstart carver has made waves for their ability to create beautifully intricate designs. Many have suggested that this new talent be offered a position as part of our administration, while others believe that this would deprive their local community. Whatever our choice, let us make sure that their talented gifts do not go to waste."
 inua_events.7.a: "Hire them."
 inua_events.7.b: "Keep them local."
 inua_events.8.t: "A Lost Knife"
 inua_events.8.d: "The knife has become an important symbol of the Inua people. Its utility in the northern winter made it a necessity for survival. Often, one would use the same knife for years and decorate it accordingly. Whether ulu or pana, the type of knife has come to be less important than its significance for the holder. The knife represents self sufficiency, the ability to tame the world and make one’s way amongst the wilds. Such a sentimental object holds an incredible importance to the owner, so it is no surprise that our ruler is dismayed at the loss of their own. Without a knife, we have lost a part of ourselves."
 inua_events.8.a: "Everyone must search!"
 inua_events.8.b: "Sorrow. Pure, unrelenting, sorrow."
 inua_events.9.t: "Qiviut Brings in Dividends"
 inua_events.9.d: "Qiviut is a material like no other. Soft, but not delicate. Warm, but not smothering. It comes from the Umingmak, a large hoofed animal which parades around the arctic plains. Underneath its outer fur, the Qiviut waits for harvest. Qiviut is worth its weight in gold to those who live in the north for its durable and warm properties. Inuans have routinely been the ones to rear and harvest the Qiviut, to the point that the material has become synonymous with the faith to outsiders. Our realm has now raked in a hefty profit from the Qiviut trade. Let us enjoy the fruits of our labor and wish for more success down the line!"
 inua_events.9.a: "We're rich!"
 inua_events.10.t: "Tuurngaq Interrupts Healing"
 inua_events.10.d: "In times of war, us Inua have a distinct advantage over our enemies. While they buck against the natural order of the world with their violence, we slip alongside the spirits and use their boons to aid in our aims. However, meddling in the world of the Inua is not something which is always safe. This is why special spiritual mediators, called angakkuq, are called upon to assist in healing and protecting our soldiers. Despite all of these measures, sometimes an evil spirit disrupts rituals and damages our resolve. These Tuurngait now terrorize our soldiers and weaken our army’s morale. Let us hope that they can recover in time."
 inua_events.10.a: "Evil will not prevail"
 inua_events.11.t: "Sedna's Blessing"
 inua_events.11.d: "There are few among the Inuans who believe in gods and goddesses. Those that do, usually believe in a single divine figure known as Anirnialuk. Yet there is a peculiar faction of Inua which reverses a pantheon of gods. One of these deities has recently shaken our realm due to their appearance along the coast. In a faint shimmer, the goddess Sedna appeared before sailors and granted unto them a great boon. They have ventured to the capital to share the word of this miracle and give us Sedna’s blessing."
 inua_events.11.a: "She has granted our ships strength!"
 inua_events.11.b: "She has blessed our merchants!"
 inua_events.11.c: "She has birthed us new talent!"
 inua_events.12.t: "Northern Kingdom"
 inua_events.12.d: "For centuries, the Inuans have been forced into the sidelines and required to watch the rest of the world blossom. No longer will this be the case, as we have brought our people back from the brink. At the dawn of the 15th century, the Inuans were dwindling in numbers and completely stateless. Now we are a force to be reckoned with and a shining example to all of the oppressed. As a brave kingdom in this northern world, we will come to unite all of the faithful and set on a new path forward. The only choice now is, what title shall our new nation hold?"
 inua_events.12.a: "We will embrace this new identity"
 inua_events.12.b: "We succeaded as [Root]"
 inua_events.13.t: "Siqqitiq Troubles"
 inua_events.13.d: "The Theanites are an infuriating bunch. They parade around their false mysticism and treat our faithful as ignorant children. Every so often, a group of Theanites venture into Inuan land and attempt to “educate” us on the proper way to practice our faith. While this is usually harmless, if not irritating for the locals, sometimes these heathens will use deception to convert a local populace. This practice, known as Siqqitiq, tries to relate Inuan concepts to that of Theanite ones and con the locals into believing they have been Inuan all along. We now face this very same trouble within our own border, we must act decisively to ensure that our realm continues to prosper and remain united."
 inua_events.13.a: "Punish them for their attempts."
 inua_events.13.b: "Do not harm their passage."
 inua_events.14.t: "Trapping Disruptions"
 inua_events.14.d: "Trapping serves as the lifeblood for many Inuans in the arctic. Selling different furs to wealthy buyers helps to fund communities throughout the Inuan world. Sadly, our current state of war has come to impact this trade. With the potential dangers that come with conflict, many buyers have left to deal with other nations to get their fur fix. We will be expected to cover the costs of these losses, hopefully the next season will bear more lucrative fruits."
 inua_events.14.a: "Punish them for their attempts."
 inua_events.15.t: "Settling the Arctic"
 inua_events.15.d: "The lands of Nunavut hold many of our Inuan brethren who live without the need for a state. They toil away, living without the benefits that true society can bring them. Such an uncivilized practice leads the rest of the world to think we are just as barbaric as them. We must rectify this situation. Sending out settlers to conquer this frontier will not only expand our state’s borders, but will also counter any claims against our advancement. Soon all of our Inuan brothers will be under one banner, ready to face the world and come out ahead."
 inua_events.15.a: "Perfect"
 inua_events.16.t: "Maligait"
 inua_events.16.d: "The natural laws of this world, known as Maligait, are things that one must do. When our ancestors made a simple living in the frigid north, the Maligait were not set in stone. Instead they were felt, just as one feels the presence of another’s gaze. With advancement we have lost connection to such laws and it has reflected in our society. Rampant today are the vile actions of the defiler, the murderer, and the thief. While they will be brought to justice when nature comes to them, some have begun to ask if we should intervene and take on this role. One of our own advisors has been found to be a violator of Maligait. If we do act against them, it must be quick and decisive."
 inua_events.16.a: "They will be punished."
 inua_events.16.b: "Nature will punish them."
 inua_events.17.t: "The Public Breath"
 inua_events.17.d: "What causes rabbits to jump and foxes to hunt? Every movement in this life is part of one fluid system, one great breath. Like the sails of a ship, everything is propelled forward by this breath. Spirits carry themselves along it, shamans try to form it, and the resilient struggle against it. It is through this breath’s shape that we get our laws and societies. Living in accordance with it moves us to the best life. During this era of peace, we are feeling the impact of living with the breath. Our society flourishes and our citizens are happy. The world rewards those who live by its order. For that, we are thankful."
 inua_events.17.a: "All is one."
 inua_events.18.t: "Tunijuti for our ally."
 inua_events.18.d: "In Inuan society, when one needs the services of a spiritual mediator, called an angakkuq, they typically give them a gift. While this ceremony of Tunijuti has slowly faded out of fashion through the centuries, the art of giving good gifts is still a prominent part of Inuan belief. All major celebrations are to be accompanied with gifts. Even on a standard day, one may surprise a loved one with a gift as a reminder of their appreciation. We have come to appreciate our allies for their propensity to assist in our administration’s interest. Perhaps it is time to remind them of our own appreciation. After all, who doesn’t love a thoughtful gift."
 inua_events.18.a: "Let us reward them!"
 inua_events.18.b: "Bah, too expensive."
 inua_events.19.t: "Tunijuti"
 inua_events.19.d: "We have received a gift from our Inuan ally. Typically within Inuan belief, gifts are given as part of a ceremony to reaffirm vows of appreciation between two parties. This Tunijuti serves as a sign of their devotion to our administration and future prosperity."
 inua_events.19.a: "We are thankful."
 inua_events.20.t: "Anirnialuk: A Question of Syncretism"
 inua_events.20.d: "There is little mention of gods and the afterlife in Inuan belief. The brutal nature of arctic life gave our ancestors little choice but to believe in a capricious and unforgiving world. Yet, this does not have to be how things stay. There are some within the Inuan world who have blended elements of the Sacramental religions with their own faith. A single divine breath, known as Anirnialuk guides the people to a blessed paradise if they obey the natural laws during this life. While these beliefs do counteract traditional doctrine, perhaps it will allow us to better relate to other faiths in this increasingly interconnected world."
 inua_events.20.a: "Of course!"
 inua_events.20.b: "They bastardize our faith!"
