 sacramental_events.1.t: "Saint Worship"
 sacramental_events.1.d: "The worship of different saints is generally regarded as a heretical practice among all branches of Sacramentalism. Most saints were particularly righteous individuals, who upon their death were mythologized by their community into divine figures. While no major branch of Sacramentalism explicitly canonizes saints, the practice of revering pious ancestors plays a large role among Theanites and Ogdonians. In our own realm, the practice of saint worship has seen some rise among the common citizens. In particular, one group of devoted worshipers have begun to petition for the construction of public works devoted to these saints. We must do something to shut down their heretical beliefs, but the question lies in the magnitude of the punishment."
 sacramental_events.1.a: "Have them put to death!"
 sacramental_events.1.b: "They must work for the churches."
 sacramental_events.1.c: "They must be educated."
 sacramental_events.2.t: "Trinitarian Scholar"
 sacramental_events.2.d: "A religious scholar in our realm has begun to spread heretical ideas. One of the key tenets of religions in the Sacramental group is Nontrinitarianism, meaning that there are three different and distinct entities of The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit. This view is generally regarded as one of the most contentious differences between the other Christian religions, like Evangelicalism and Catholicism, and the Sacramental faiths. In our own realm, a religious scholar has recently published a treatise on the nature of the Holy Spirit, implying it to be a part of the Son and the Father. This notion is completely heretical and something must be done to ensure that the people are not led astray. We can have one of our own advisors publish a response to his thesis, exile him from our state, or have him put to death. Whatever the choice, it will send a message to those in the future who will think about challenging the Sacramental status quo."
 sacramental_events.2.a: "Use his teachings to bolster our faith."
 sacramental_events.2.b: "Exile from the state."
 sacramental_events.2.c: "Show him the seperate wrath of the son, father, and spirit."
 sacramental_events.3.t: "Man Claims to Be Jesus"
 sacramental_events.3.d: "The same daily routines continued throughout the capital as they always had. The nobles readied themselves for leisure and the paupers scrounged for coins. Yet, there was a feeling of tranquility in the air. The breeze shimmered, the water’s ripples melted into blissful arcs, and the sounds of birds chirped in a harmonious chorus. This tranquility was prematurely cut as an unwashed man stumbled his way throughout the streets, bumping and crashing against the surrounding buildings. He now stands in front of us, claiming to be the vessel of Jesus Christ. Tradition Sacramental teachings posit that the Jesus of Nazareth, Adam-ondi-Ahman, and the Salt Lake are three different earthly bodies inhabited by the soul of The Son. While this man’s claims of being Jesus are certainly possible, it is highly unlikely."
 sacramental_events.3.a: "An Obviously False Claims."
 sacramental_events.3.b: "My Lord!"
 sacramental_events.4.t: "Sacramental Artifact"
 sacramental_events.4.d: "We have been approached by a traveling merchant to purchase a unique Sacramental artifact. Many items related to the life of Jesus Christ have become sought after by Sacramental rulers for their rarity and religious significance. Several iconic items have been thought to give divine benefits, such as the robe Jeus of the Salt Lake was baptized in. Over time, these artifacts spread throughout the continent and ended up in the hands of dukes and merchants. If this merchant tells the truth, buying such an artifact would be well worth whatever price they offer."
 sacramental_events.4.a: "I will purchase it!"
 sacramental_events.4.b: "Expensive and likely fake."
 sacramental_events.5.t: "Artefict Dude"
 sacramental_events.5.d: "We have been led astray! The supposedly “valuable” Sacramental artifact was a clear fake. Not only have we lost our money, but anyone to punish. The merchant has quickly left our state and is likely on their way to scam another monarch out of their hard-earned ducats. May nothing but fire and damnation become of them."
 sacramental_events.5.a: "I knew it!"
 sacramental_events.6.t: "A Holy Artifact"
 sacramental_events.6.d: "After verifying with several of our realm’s scholars, the religious artifact sold to us by a traveling merchant has been found to be authentic. With the legitimacy of such an item, we will become the envy of the entire Sacramental world!"
 sacramental_events.6.a: "Blessed Day"
 sacramental_events.7.t: "Scriptures Translated into Common Language"
 sacramental_events.7.d: "This new age of progress has come to threaten our Sacramental tradition. Typically, access to the Scriptures is a privilege only enjoyed by the most well learned of our society. However, with the rise of the printing press, we now face the problem of a widespread translated version of the Scriptures. If the common citizen gets their hands on it, it is likely that they might be led astray to believe in heretical thought. While the printing press has proved invaluable in its efficiency, maybe it would do us well to restrict its use to only the secular. Otherwise, we may have a full blown reformation on our hands."
 sacramental_events.7.a: "Spread it far and wide!"
 sacramental_events.7.b: "Stop its spread."
 sacramental_events.8.t: "Israel Found"
 sacramental_events.8.d: "Far beyond the seas, we have discovered the lands of Israel.The Scriptures describe three different points in history during which Jesus Christ came down from heaven to our earthly plane. In the Middle Testament, he is described to have lived in a land called “Israel.” Many medieval scholars believed this place to be sunk beneath the waves in the wake of the Flood, yet our explorers have come upon various signs of its existence. Most prominent is the mountain Sinai, described in the Old Testament as being the place where Moses received the Ten Commandments. This discovery has shaken the Sacramental world and affirmed the truth of our faith to many nonbelievers. As the ones to announce this discovery, we have benefitted particularly among the pious in our own populace."
 sacramental_events.8.a: "Wonderous"
 sacramental_events.9.t: "Commercial Rhetoric"
 sacramental_events.9.d: "The conflict between commerce and Sacramental teachings has been a contentious one ever since the ending days of the American empire. As the world becomes more connected, many have begun to earn greater fortunes and attempt to expand their wealth further. While this seems to be a positive thing on the surface, it is considered by some Sacramental scholars to be a sinful practice. In the New Testament, Jesus of the Salt Lake warns against “machinations of Greed” and “placing coin over cross.” Our own realm is host to many merchants who are seeking to make themselves rich, it is our job to make sure that they are following the righteous path in their endeavors."
 sacramental_events.9.a: "Let the trade be free and plentiful!"
 sacramental_events.9.b: "Greed is not the way of the prophet"
 sacramental_events.10.t: "Public Jockeys for Religious Conflict"
 sacramental_events.10.d: "Our public is demanding that we act against one of our neighbors. Sacramental teachings, especially in the New Testament, call for the conversion of heathens by force. Jesus of the Salt Lake founded the American Empire and expanded it throughout the American continent in order to spread the one true faith. In the same way, we must act viciously against those who wish to blind the citizens of the world from salvation. Now they surround us, preaching their false beliefs right on our border. Our citizens are calling on us to act in accordance to the righteous path, let us not disappoint them."
 sacramental_events.10.a: "To War!"
 sacramental_events.11.t: "Classicalism"
 sacramental_events.11.d: "Classicalism originated in California as a movement to revive the Pre-Sacramental state of the Union. Before the arrival of Samson centuries ago, the Union was the forefront of American civilization. The scientific discoveries and philosophical advancements of the Union were unmatched by any civilization. After the fall of the Francisco Presidency in the wake of the War of the Mad, many Classical documents were brought back into the public consciousness by Sunkiss scholars. The spread of these documents through the continent spurred a scientific revolution which sprouted movements like Realism and Humanism. Many of the key tenets of the Classical movement, an individual focus and questioning of Christian traditions, are fundamentally opposed to Sacramentalism. We must decide now if we are going to embrace this new tradition or suppress it for the years to come."
 sacramental_events.11.a: "Utterly Profane!"
 sacramental_events.11.b: "It enlightens us."
 sacramental_events.12.t: "Embrace our Differences"
 sacramental_events.12.d: "With our move towards a more tolerant society, many in our state have come to recognize the similarities in our brothers of the Sacramental faith. While we may differ on minutiae, we all believe in the prophet and our divine parents. If we are to survive in such a bitterly divided world, it would be best that we do it together. No longer will we be Theanites, Ogdonians, or Ecclesials, but instead one Sacramental family."
 sacramental_events.12.a: "We are one"
 sacramental_events.13.t: "Crushing the Heretics"
 sacramental_events.13.d: "With our move to a more theologically pure society, we have come to recognize the flaws inherent in the heretical beliefs of other Sacramentalists. We must act quickly to ensure that they cannot spread this disease of heresy to their children or grandchildren. Every missionary in the realm must ready themselves now as they would for battle, for the greatest of all evils lies within our very borders and is only growing with time."
 sacramental_events.13.a: "To War!"
 sacramental_events.14.t: "The Constitutionalist Question"
 sacramental_events.14.d: "Sacramentalists and Constitutionalists have a complicated history. The Constitutionalists trace their faith back to the original Union of California, founded before the dawn of the American empire. During the early days of the Union, the Partisan faith was formalized between 15 divided parties from around the California region. The Partisan faith of the time was polytheistic and interpreted the Constitution in a much different way than the current Partisans do. The major change came with the arrival of the apostle Samosn, who was instructed by Jesus of the Salt Lake to convert the Union of California and merge it into the American Empire. While Samson managed to do the latter, the former proved much more difficult. Partisanity emerged as a blend between the Sacramental and Constitutionalist which slowly spread from San Francisco into the rest of California. In our modern age, we must make the tough decision if they are to be considered Sacramental heretics or unique heathens."
 sacramental_events.14.a: "Of course they are sacramental."
 sacramental_events.14.b: "Not just heretics, but HEATHENS!"
 sacramental_events.15.t: "Charity of the State"
 sacramental_events.15.d: "Jesus of the Salt Lake, Nazareth, and Adam-ondi-Ahman all preached a message of charity. During the height of the American empire, almost all of the realm’s excess budget went to improving the lives of the impoverished. As heirs to this legacy in our own Sacramental disposition, it is our job to continue to spread the wealth we have been given to those who need it most. Of course, some Sacramental scholars have argued that acts of charity are perceived as necessary holy acts which directly contrasts the entire “by faith alone” doctrine. Whatever our choice, let it be in support of the almighty above."
 sacramental_events.15.a: "We act according to Christ"
 sacramental_events.15.b: "It is not the correct way!"
 sacramental_events.16.t: "Feasting Day"
 sacramental_events.16.d: "Feasting day is one of the only holidays celebrated by Sacramentalists other than Easter and Christmas. The tradition originated from Jesus of the Salt Lake, who would hold a large feast in the seventh month every year. Every citizen of the empire would be invited to the capital in order to partake in the festivites. The holiday spread along with Peter’s flock in their journey to Canada and was adopted by many early Theanite converts. Our realm now readies itself to host a large feast in celebration of this ancient tradition. As we enjoy the blessings of the almighty, let us not forget its divine origin."
 sacramental_events.16.a: "A glorious celebration!"
 sacramental_events.17.t: "Science and the Scripture"
 sacramental_events.17.d: "The advancement of philosophies and science hasn’t always challenged Sacramental teachings. During the time of Jesus of the Salt Lake, many philosophers throughout the empire would come to challenge his beliefs. Yet despite this, the prophet always managed to give them satisfactory answers and sate their curiosity. Without the ultiment arbiter of all theological matters, many in the Sacramental world have struggled to answer some of the most difficult scientific and philosophical questions of our day. In such an environment, we must make sure that our realm acts in a divinely guided way to avoid heresy or leading our citizens astray."
 sacramental_events.17.a: "Science has its faults"
 sacramental_events.17.b: "It is all within God's plan"
 sacramental_events.17.c: "Wait... That's Heresy!"
 sacramental_events.18.t: "Light of Honesty"
 sacramental_events.18.d: "Our realm has become mired in corruption and deceit, but luckily the light of honesty still prevails. Many of the most corrupt members of our realm have come forward to ask for forgiveness. During the life of Jesus of the Salt lake, when the elders of Mormon left him to die in Promontory, he quickly forgave them and worked with them to found the American Empire. It is wise for us to follow in his footsteps and take this opportunity to further snuff out the sinful corruption that now gunks up all aspects of our state. Let all the sinful be afraid of the light of honesty and those with good hearts come to thrive in it."
 sacramental_events.18.a: "The sinfull will be brought to justice!"
 sacramental_events.19.t: "Pondering the Nature of Divinity"
 sacramental_events.19.d: "Divinity is a complicated and contentious subject within Sacramental tradition. It is widely accepted that Jesus of the Salt Lake, Nazareth, and Adam-ondi-Ahman were beings inhabited by the spirit of Christ in three different earthly vessels. However, how exactly Christ came to be involved in these vessels is a point of contention. Occupationists believe that the spirit of Christ occupies the vessels at some point during their lives. Others believe that Christ was “reincarnated” into these vessels from their birth and then grew within them until his return to heaven. The division between these two views is not defined on a branch by branch basis, with no official ruling from the Ogden council or any other religious body. In a conversation with one of our advisors, we were asked about our specific view on the matter. How do we respond?"
 sacramental_events.19.a: "It is not a reincarnation, but instead an occupation."
 sacramental_events.19.b: "It is obviously a reincarnation."
 sacramental_events.19.c: "It is neither, it is the same Jesus each time."
 sacramental_events.19.e: "You think too much."
 sacramental_events.20.t: "Divine Right of Rule"
 sacramental_events.20.d: "Throughout the ages, many rulers have based their right to rule on being chosen by the almighty. Generally, the logic follows that if the almighty did not want them to rule, then they would be stricken down from their position. In this new time of absolute rulers, many of our subjects have come to see us in this same light. Exploiting this position would certainly allow us to further strengthen our rule and move towards creating a more divine realm."
 sacramental_events.20.a: "As is our birthright!"
 sacramental_events.21.t: "Canadian Leadership Lost"
 sacramental_events.21.d: "A tragic fate has befallen the Ecclesial faith as our main protector, the Empire of Canada, has fallen to Islamic heathens! In a swift change of power, the Canadian emperor was defeated and his empire annexed. For the last two centuries, the Canadian empire has protected Ecclesial nations from Islamic Caliphs and Theanite Warchiefs, but we must now fend for ourselves. The days ahead certainly look dark for our faith, but we must be strong in order to ensure that we survive into the coming centuries."
 sacramental_events.21.a: "Horror!"
 sacramental_events.22.t: "Ecclesial Efficiency"
 sacramental_events.22.d: "Ecclesianity has always fostered a particular sense of efficiency in its adherents. Most Ecclesial denominations espouse the benefits of hard work in creating a divinely organized society. Denominations have become a backbone in Ecclesial economies by giving out loans and controlling some of the largest trading companies. This form of spiritual and economic integration is absent in the controlling Ogdonians and wispy Theanites, so it is no wonder that the Ecclesials have managed to create some of the most wealthy societies on the American continent. We are now left with the difficult decision as to what to do with this efficiency."
 sacramental_events.22.a: "It is what makes us best"
 sacramental_events.22.b: "It is what fills my coffers"
 sacramental_events.23.t: "Denominations offended by artist"
 sacramental_events.23.d: "Our artist has recently created a piece which has come to offend some of the denominations in our state. The piece in question depicts the journey of Peter to the city of Toronto during the harsh winter. The denomination takes issue with the depiction of Peter, as many see his divine stance as being unfitting for an apostle. The different Ecclesial denominations often bicker over the role of Peter in our faith, whether he is of a divine or mortal persuasion. Whatever the case, our artist has put us in the unenviable position of making a public statement on the matter."
 sacramental_events.23.a: "They are too sensitive"
 sacramental_events.23.b: "They will be reprimanded for this"
 sacramental_events.23.c: "They will be exiled for this"
 sacramental_events.24.t: "The Scriptures and the Testament of Peter"
 sacramental_events.24.d: "The Scriptures are the shared religious documents of the Sacramental faith containing the Old Testament, Middle Testament, and New Testament. Particular branches of Sacramentalism have their own religious documents as well, such as the Ogdonian bible. Some Ecclesial denominations hold the “Testament of Peter” to be a document on the same standing as the Scriptures. The document is an account of Peter’s journey to Canada and outlines the foundations of a ununified faith split among different denominations and individual beliefs. While our ancestors may have avoided making a judgment on this questionable matter, we will not be so flimsy. Let us make the final decision for those in our realm to follow."
 sacramental_events.24.a: "It is of the same importance"
 sacramental_events.24.b: "It is below the word of the divine"
 sacramental_events.25.t: "Daughters of Peter"
 sacramental_events.25.d: "We have recently been approached by a multi-denominational organization known as the “Daughters of Peter.” They have presented us with a case for the equality of women in our society, including opening the royal cabinet to both of the sexes. While Ecclesial realms are certainly more accepting then their Ogdonian counterparts, full equality has remained a nonstarter for centuries. These “Daughters of Peter” have begun to open denominations to the idea, but need royal support in order to really achieve their goals. Accepting their demands will likely provide us with a wider pool of talent to choose from and less headaches from future equality movements, but would certainly weaken our royal control over the different denominations in our state. Whatever the choice, let it be for the good of all of the Lord’s children."
 sacramental_events.25.a: "They are our divine equals."
 sacramental_events.25.b: "Of course not!"
 sacramental_events.26.t: "Classis offer "Donation""
 sacramental_events.26.d: "The Polites are a fearsome group. Unlike most other denominations, their polities are led by a single Classis who holds absolute power. These Classis usually command their entire community and are often at odds with their local lords. A particularly powerful Classis has just approached us and offered a “donation.” With this donation came the wish that we turn a blind eye to the actions of their polity. While this is certainly an immoral and heretical action, the donation could be used to provide for the impoverished or help us in our own endeavors."
 sacramental_events.26.a: "We reject such an offer!"
 sacramental_events.26.b: "Well, it is tempting."
 sacramental_events.27.t: "Classis revolts against Monarch"
 sacramental_events.27.d: "The Polites are a fearsome group. Unlike most other denominations, their polities are led by a single Classis who holds absolute power. One of these Classis has risen up against us due to our supposed “lack of legitimacy.” Throughout history, Classis have often attempted to grasp power out of the hands of monarchs due to their prominent status and control of polities. We must make an example of this unruly worm to ensure that no other heretic may come to challenge our reign."
 sacramental_events.27.a: "Crush them!"
 sacramental_events.28.t: "Petersons make a donation"
 sacramental_events.28.d: "The Petersons are the largest Ecclesial denomination. Originating soon after the death of Peter, hence the name Peter-son, the denomination spread throughout the Great Lakes along with Torontan settlers. The Petersons are led by varying levels of elder councils, each of which are usually divided on internal doctrine. One of these councils has passed a proposal to give our monarch a donation, with nothing expected in return. While this is certainly strange, it is not out of the ordinary for such a jumbled group."
 sacramental_events.28.a: "Thanks?"
 sacramental_events.29.t: "Elder Council Causes Turmoil Amongst Petersons"
 sacramental_events.29.d: "The Petersons are the largest Ecclesial denomination. Originating soon after the death of Peter, hence the name Peter-son, the denomination spread throughout the Great Lakes along with Torontan settlers. The Petersons are led by varying levels of elder councils, each of which are usually divided on internal doctrine. These divisions sometimes express themselves in the most unfortunate of ways. Just recently, the highest elder council was embroiled in a debate which consumed them for six months. Our lack of comment on the issue of debate, an issue which has already become forgotten, has caused many Petersons to be dissatisfied with our realm. The early whispers of revolution have even begun to leave the lips of some members. We must make sure that whatever comes to pass does not impact our rule."
 sacramental_events.29.a: "Great, not it is our problem."
 sacramental_events.30.t: "Santific Attempts to Purify our Monarch"
 sacramental_events.30.d: "Santifics are an interesting Ecclesial denomination. They believe, similar to the Ogdonians, that Christ inhabited the body of an individual and purified it of sin rather than being reincarnated into a new vessel. Their name originates from the idea that someone can be “sanctified” from their sin to be made pure in a manner similar to Catholic penance. Many santifics throughout our realm have asked that our ruler be sanctified in order to be sin free in his judgment. Accepting their demands would likely make them more inclined to accept our rule, but rejecting it could signal to the other denominations that our leaning lies more with them."
 sacramental_events.30.a: "I Accept their Purification."
 sacramental_events.30.b: "A Heretical and Strange Practice!"
 sacramental_events.31.t: "Santifics flock to our state to assist"
 sacramental_events.31.d: "Santifics are an interesting Ecclesial denomination. They believe, similar to the Ogdonians, that Christ inhabited the body of an individual and purified it of sin rather than being reincarnated into a new vessel. Most Santifics live an extremely charitable and selfless lifestyle, almost to the point of self destruction. A large organization within the Santific denomination provides aid to those hurt in battle. Now that our realm finds itself in a state of war, Santifics from throughout the Ecclesial world have flocked to our state in order to give assistance to our wounded."
 sacramental_events.31.a: "Their help is appreciated"
 sacramental_events.32.t: "Deans give praise to our ruler"
 sacramental_events.32.d: "The Deans are a strange Ecclesial denomination. They believe that the ruler of their realm holds absolute divine authority and is subsequently the source of divine knowledge. While the Deans are small in number, they are certainly fervent in their belief. Recently the Deans have engaged in a campaign of evangelism, spreading the good news of our ruler to all of those in the realm. Most have rejected their message, but some have taken it to heart. Through the Dean’s hard work we have gained a more legitimate rule."
 sacramental_events.32.a: "We appreciate their support"
 sacramental_events.33.t: "Deans request we visit them"
 sacramental_events.33.d: "The Deans are a strange Ecclesial denomination. They believe that the ruler of their realm holds absolute divine authority and is subsequently the source of heavenly knowledge. While the Deans are small in number, they are certainly fervent in their belief. The denominational council has recently planned a festival to be held in our honor and pleaded that we attend. While attending would certainly improve their view of us, it would be incredibly damaging for our relation with the other denominations."
 sacramental_events.33.a: "Of course!"
 sacramental_events.33.b: "We will not play into their heretical worship!"
 sacramental_events.34.t: "Calls for a Grand Synod"
 sacramental_events.34.d: "Some throughout our state have called for a grand synod. Frequently throughout the history of Ecclesial realms, when the different denominations become too rowdy the monarch will hold a synod in order to solve disputes. Through solving these disputes, the realm typically comes out more united in the faith. However, in our current age there is something to be said for a more decentralized church. By letting the denominations continue to have their own disputes, we can create a realm more accustomed to religious disagreement and be extension more tolerant."
 sacramental_events.34.a: "It is not necessary"
 sacramental_events.34.b: "We must consolidate the faith"
 sacramental_events.35.t: "Rise of the Fitts"
 sacramental_events.35.d: "A new Ecclesial denomination has arisen in our state. They call themselves the Fitts and espouse belief in a divine “closeness” between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Furthermore, they advocate for the elimination of all visual depictions of Jesus and the apostles as well as an abolition of all other denominations. Their beliefs have emerged as a blend between the Islamic and Ecclesial faiths intermingling in our realm. As a denomination with heavy Islamic influence, they have already been widely rebuked by many of the other Ecclesial groups, but their message is quickly spreading. From town to town, their devout preachers are establishing a strong presence in communities and creating new members. The Fitts’s insistence on being the only true denomination has led many of their members to harass and attack other Ecclesial groups. What this means for our realm and the future of the Ecclesial faith is unknown, but we must be on guard lest they become a threat."
 sacramental_events.35.a: "Interesting"
 sacramental_events.36.t: "Rise of the Fitts"
 sacramental_events.36.d: "A new Ecclesial denomination is causing calamity across the Great Lakes. They call themselves the Fitts and espouse belief in a divine “closeness” between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Furthermore, they advocate for the elimination of all visual depictions of Jesus and the apostles as well as an abolition of all other denominations. Their beliefs have emerged as a blend between the Islamic and Ecclesial faiths intermingling in our realm. As a denomination with heavy Islamic influence, they have already been widely rebuked by many of the other Ecclesial groups, but their message is quickly spreading. From town to town, their devout preachers are establishing a strong presence in communities and creating new members. The Fitts’s insistence on being the only true denomination has led many of their members to harass and attack other Ecclesial groups. What this means for our realm and the future of the Ecclesial faith is unknown, but we must be on guard lest they become a threat."
 sacramental_events.36.a: "Interesting"
 sacramental_events.37.t: "Fitts Flood into our State"
 sacramental_events.37.d: "The Fitts have come to our borders and begun to flood into our state. Their message is of grave concern for the other denominations, but they hold no particular malice for our monarch. Instead, they are working diligently to become the only Ecclesial force within our state. Already, our populace has become distraught with the new changes. Despite the wishes of many in our realm, the Fitts are now here to stay. All we can hope is that their fervor calms from its current fever pitch."
 sacramental_events.37.a: "Interesting"
 sacramental_events.38.t: "Denominations denounce Fitts"
 sacramental_events.38.d: "Denominations throughout our state have begun to denounce the Fitts. The new denomination has caused waves of calamity in their aggressive expansion and animosity to other older denominations. In a pan-denominational treatise, the Ecclesial community has asked our monarch to officially declare the Fitts a heretic group and discourage their spread. While it is unlikely that we could completely stop them in their tracks, doing such a measure would gain us immense favor with the majority of denominations. On the other hand, it goes against Ecclesial principles to meddle directly in the affairs of a denomination in such a way. Whatever our choice, let it be in the service of The Lord above and for the good of our realm."
 sacramental_events.38.a: "They are completely heretical!"
 sacramental_events.38.b: "They are a denomination like any other."
 sacramental_events.39.t: "Fitts flee to colonies"
 sacramental_events.39.d: "The calamity surrounding the Fitts has caused many of the denomination to flee our state to the world across the sea. This poses both positive and negative prospects. On one hand, encouraging the Fitts to leave would likely bolster our colony’s numbers and calm the religious turmoil they caused. On the other hand, it is likely that too much encouragement might cause the remaining Fitts to become victims to persecution by the emboldened denominations."
 sacramental_events.39.a: "Encourage them to leave."
 sacramental_events.39.b: "Let them move as they wish"
 sacramental_events.40.t: "Denomination formed in colony"
 sacramental_events.40.d: "Across the waves, a new denomination has emerged in our colony. We received the news by letter a month after it was sent, so it is likely that this new group has continued to grow in our absence of action. While there is nothing inherently heretical in the foundation of a new denomination, its presence could foster a sense of independence from our overseas colony. Suppressing its spread will cause some resistance from our colony in the meantime, but could prevent losing it in the future."
 sacramental_events.40.a: "Supress this spread"
 sacramental_events.40.b: "Allow it to flourish"
 sacramental_events.41.t: "Council Falls to Foreign Power"
 sacramental_events.41.d: "The worst has come to pass. The council of Ogden has fallen to a foreign power who does not share our appreciation of their divine knowledge. In the chaos of war, many of the council fled to surrounding realms and left the Ogdonian world without religious guidance. While they work to recompose and create a council in exile, we will bear the brunt of the turmoil. Already, some in our state have begun to turn their backs on the council for their inability to prevent their own downfall. For the sake of the council, we must endure."
 sacramental_events.41.a: "This is grave news"
 sacramental_events.42.t: "Council Requests our Assistance"
 sacramental_events.42.d: "The council of Ogden has approached our realm as the site for their temporary operations. While the city of Ogden is under the control of a foreign power, the council needs a place to gather in order to ensure that the Ogdonian world is not left without guidance. As the protectors of the council, we will certainly gain a level of divine legitimacy. However, there is also the chance that hosting the council will lead some members to meddle in our realm’s operations. If we do choose to host the council, we must be absolutely sure that we are the right people for the job."
 sacramental_events.42.a: "We shall accept them with grace!"
 sacramental_events.42.b: "Not our nation!"
 sacramental_events.43.t: "Council Returns to Ogden"
 sacramental_events.43.d: "After their period in exile, the council of Ogden is finally ready to return to their home in Utah. During their time in our state, they provided the Ogdonian world with guidance in matters of the faith. This time of division was one of the many tests which Elohim throws at his faithful and luckily we made it to the other side in one piece. Glory to the council, may they be guided by the heavens above!"
 sacramental_events.43.a: "Finally!"
 sacramental_events.44.t: "Council Embroiled in Debate"
 sacramental_events.44.d: "The council of Ogden often becomes embroiled in debate over different religious topics. While it certainly causes some disruption in the wider Ogdonian world, it rarely has any lasting impacts. Sometimes different rulers are invited to Ogden in order to give their thoughts on the matter. This is a high sign of respect, but attending is usually more of a headache than staying home. Either a ruler commits too hard to a particular view and alienates part of the council or takes too weak of a stance and is seen as flimsy. Whatever our choice, let us be careful to not make a fool of ourselves."
 sacramental_events.44.a: "Take part in the discourse."
 sacramental_events.44.b: "Allow it to flourish."
 sacramental_events.45.t: "Ogden sends missionaries"
 sacramental_events.45.d: "Ogden has seen our current state of affairs and sent some assistance in the form of missionaries. Our nation is divided religiously with folks of different persuasion causing unrest for our majority. While the council usually stays out of political affairs, they will occasionally offer a hand to particular realms which are struggling. Let us give thanks to the council for their gift and praise Elohim for his guidance."
 sacramental_events.45.a: "We are gracious for their support!"
 sacramental_events.46.t: "Ogden sends volunteers"
 sacramental_events.46.d: "Ogden has seen our current state of affairs and sent some assistance in the form of volunteers. Our nation is currently in dire need of some additional manpower to fill our ranks. In times like these, the council typically provides assistance to the nations which have served as model examples of Ogdonian ideals. With this blessing, we will be able to steer towards the path of recovery. Let us give thanks to the council for their gift and praise Elohim for his guidance."
 sacramental_events.46.a: "We are gracious for their support!"
 sacramental_events.47.t: "Funding the monestaries"
 sacramental_events.47.d: "Unlike most other Sacramental branches, Ogdonians have a particular bend towards asceticism. This leaning has led to the creation of many large monasteries throughout the Ogdonian world. The task of funding these monasteries has traditionally fallen to the council, but sometimes they need extra assistance. Such is the case in our realm as many monks have asked our ruler to invest in their monasteries. Handing over the cash could greatly improve these influential monks' opinion of our state, possibly giving us more power in the religious lives of our cities. On the other hand, it really should be the job of the council to fund these monasteries and maintain their well being. Perhaps it is better to wait and let the Ogden do its job rather than intervening."
 sacramental_events.47.a: "They are central to the faith!"
 sacramental_events.47.b: "Expensive."
 sacramental_events.48.t: "Gaining influence in the Council"
 sacramental_events.48.d: "Some of our advisors have discretely proposed the idea of infiltrating the Ogdonian council. The council is composed of two quorums totaling 140 elders, with each member hand selected from a pool of philosophers and theologians from throughout the Ogdonian world. One of our advisors has a connection to several of these elders who would be willing to act on our behalf in exchange for titles and land. This would certainly be a risky operation if we were to undertake it, but it would give us powerful control over aspects of the council and its operation. Sacrilegious or not, we must seriously consider this opertunity."
 sacramental_events.48.a: "Perhaps"
 sacramental_events.48.b: "It is immoral!"
 sacramental_events.49.t: "Influenced Council Vote"
 sacramental_events.49.d: "Our own operatives in the council have successfully influenced one of their votes in our favor. The new ruling reflects our own positions as an integral part of Ogdonian doctrine. Our decision to infiltrate the council has started to bear major fruit, but we must be careful to avoid being discovered. The council continues to be vigilant of any outside influence."
 sacramental_events.49.a: "All According to Plan!"
 sacramental_events.50.t: "Fraudulent plot discovered!"
 sacramental_events.50.d: "Our careful house of cards has come crashing down. One of the elders that was part of our plot to influence the council confessed to one of their closest colleagues. The news spread quickly throughout the council and we have been officially rebuked by their state. Many members of the Ogdonian world now look at us with great disdain. We have committed a grave sin, let us home that Elohim can forgive our arrogence."
 sacramental_events.50.a: "Damn!"
 sacramental_events.51.t: "Ogdonian Ingenuity"
 sacramental_events.51.d: "While the Theanites and Ecclesials are constantly at odds with progress due to their respective mystical and divided nature, us Ogdonians are usually at the forefront of innovation. The American Empire during its time quickly advanced technologically compared to its neighbors. The combination of classical Partisan literature and the economy of scale created by the empire’s size allowed for a wide pool of talent and diversity of thought. These conditions fostered a type of intellectual rigor which never spread to the Ecclesial and Theanite branches. Ever since, the Ogdonians have held an ingenuity matched by no other."
 sacramental_events.51.a: "The founder's blessing"
 sacramental_events.52.t: "Profits of the sinful drink"
 sacramental_events.52.d: "While the council of Ogden has given no official ban on the consumption of wine, Ogdonians generally regard the drink as holding a sinful nature. Despite this, Italy and Occitania create some of the most popular wines on the Mexican and American continents. This is partially due to the fact that the wines are not used for domestic consumption, but instead shipped abroad to other realms. The wine created in our own realm has served us similarly in creating a sizable profit. We must now decide if we wish to enrich ourselves with its use or invest it in expanding production further."
 sacramental_events.52.a: "Sell it to the heretics!"
 sacramental_events.52.b: "Reinvest it in improving our harvest"
 sacramental_events.53.t: "Excess Individualism"
 sacramental_events.53.d: "In this age of modern luxuries, some of our own citizens have become obsessed with their own individual pleasure. Modern philosophies teach them that it is okay to enjoy their excess, but Ogdonian teachings say otherwise. To avoid leading our nation astray, we must do something to clamp down on these new age thoughts. May our decision be guided by the wisdom of the council and the will of Elohim."
 sacramental_events.53.a: "This is not our way"
 sacramental_events.53.b: "It is the right direction for the faith"
 sacramental_events.54.t: "Elders of Mormon visit our nation"
 sacramental_events.54.d: "The Elders of Mormon have come to visit our nation. A mysterious group, the Mormons originate from a time before the arrival of Jesus of the Salt Lake as the rulers of Utah. When Jesus first preached his message, the Elders of Mormon exiled him to the vast desert in the east. Thinking him to be dead, the Elders of Mormon suppressed the burgeoning Sacramental faith and exiled many of his followers to the same desert. After 4 nights, Jesus returned with his followers, bearing gifts of fruit and meat for the citizens of Salt Lake City. Even though Jesus would eventually work with the Elders to found the American Empire, the Mormons have routinely been persecuted by the Sacramentals throughout history. They now approach our realm to offer our ruler some of their wisdom. Such ancient wisdom would surely be enlightening, but aligning ourselves with the enemies of the prophet is a dangerous game."
 sacramental_events.54.a: "Accept their wisdom"
 sacramental_events.54.b: "Reject their message"
 sacramental_events.55.t: "Spreading the Ogdonian Bible"
 sacramental_events.55.d: "The Scriptures are the shared religious documents of the Sacramental faith containing the Old Testament, Middle Testament, and New Testament. Particular branches of Sacramentalism have their own religious documents as well, such as the Ogdonian Bible. This document was created by the council of Ogden, not as continuation of the scripture, but a compilation of various council rulings. The book is generally used as a guide for priests to give advice to members of their congregation, but lately it has become available to all through the printing press. While this isn’t explicitly a bad thing, there is the potential that some new council rulings might override the old ones. If this were to occur, the general populace might be confused as to the new edition and cling to the old belief. We can intervene in order to prevent this confusion or let it take its course."
 sacramental_events.55.a: "Restrict Its Spread!"
 sacramental_events.55.b: "Let the word spread!"
 sacramental_events.56.t: "The Question of Universal Priesthood"
 sacramental_events.56.d: "The major point of disagreement between the Ecclesial and Ogdonian branches of Sacramentalism was on the doctrine of priesthood. Ecclesials cling to the notion of a universal priesthood, an idea which was popularized by the Testament of Peter. Us Ogdonians have always clung to the traditional idea that the council of Ogden must approve members of the Priesthood, as was the role of the Quorum of apostles in the American empire. Yet, some theologians have come to challenge this idea in our state. Throughout the centuries, the standard for acceptance as a priest has fallen dramatically. Many argue that the consent of the council is not just a formality which bears no meaning. If we were to proclaim our realm to consist of a universal priesthood, we would finally mark an end to this debate."
 sacramental_events.56.a: "It was Jesus's Desire"
 sacramental_events.56.b: "It contradicts the scriptures!"
 sacramental_events.57.t: "Performing the Ordinences"
 sacramental_events.57.d: "The term Sacramentalism originates from The Final Sacrament which was performed by Jesus of the Salt Lake in the new testament. From this most branches of Sacramentalism derive the doctrine of “justification by faith alone.” Despite all of this, some branches of Sacramentalism still perform some sort of rituals, but only in a symbolic manner. These “ordinances” are typically seen as backwards in modern connotations, but can serve to appease some of the most traditional citizens. Our ruler has been asked to perform the ordinances by an aging lord. What should be our response?"
 sacramental_events.57.a: "Useless Postering"
 sacramental_events.57.b: "It is what the people expect"
 sacramental_events.58.t: "Collapse of the Ogdonian Faith"
 sacramental_events.58.d: "Over the past centuries, the Ogdonian faith has slowly declined to the point of near obscurity. This is a truth we must come to accept. Whether it be a fault of the council or our own, we must make peace and decide how we are to move forward. Some in our realm have suggested that we move towards a path of conversion. If Elohim believes us to be on the wrong path, this would be his way of telling us. Whatever choice we make, let it be the one guided by his hand."
 sacramental_events.58.a: "We must stay with the faith!"
 sacramental_events.58.b: "We move to the theanite persuasion"
 sacramental_events.58.c: "We move to the ecclesial persuasion"
 sacramental_events.58.e: "We move to the partisan persuasion"
 sacramental_events.58.f: "We move to the anarchist persuasion"
 sacramental_events.58.g: "We move to the despotic persuasion"
 sacramental_events.59.t: "Ogdonian Resurgence"
 sacramental_events.59.d: "Despite the hardships, the Ogdonian faith has managed to endure! While many of our brothers and sisters may have strayed from the holy path, we stuck with Elohim and he has rewarded us. As one of the last remaining heirs to the true Sacramental heritage, we must ensure that no misfortune arrives to snuff out our flame. Let us share our glory to the world! For the council! For Elohim!"
 sacramental_events.59.a: "We have endured!"
 sacramental_events.60.t: "The Earthly Kingdom"
 sacramental_events.60.d: "Through centuries of expansion, we have managed to raise our realm to a sublime height. This work has not gone unnoticed, as the council of Ogden has granted us a great blessing. In a unanimous vote, we were proclaimed the “Earthly Kingdom.” This unique title is rarely given by the council, only being used to describe the American Empire and the short-lived United Kingdom of California. As the Earthly Kingdom, we will represent the Ogdonian faith on the world stage. Our doctrine will be aligned with the council and the council will likely favor us in their rulings. While this is certainly a great honor, we must remember the incredible responsibility which it also contains. It is our job to protect the Ogdonian faith and remain righteous in our rule. May the guidance of Elohim assist us in this new age."
 sacramental_events.60.a: "Above all others"
 sacramental_events.60.b: "We are unique above all others"
 sacramental_events.61.t: "Commune with the Heavenly Mother"
 sacramental_events.61.d: "As opposed to their Ogdonian and Ecclesial brethren, Theanites worship the Heavenly Mother. Most Sacramental faiths acknowledge that there exists a Heavenly Mother, wife of the Heavenly Father, yet for centuries little worship was given to this divine figure. It wasn’t until the collapse of the Metis empire, and the emergence of the Plainwalkers that Sacramental traditions blended with the archaic Tayr faith to create the new Theanite branch. The Heavenly Mother is seen by Theanites as being closely related to the maintenance of our world while the Heavenly Father manages spiritual affairs. Often in their times of need, different Theanite rulers will call upon the Heavenly Mother to assist them in ruling their realm. Performing a ceremony and communing with the mother of our Earth would go far in placing the divine on our side."
 sacramental_events.61.a: "We need her guidance"
 sacramental_events.61.b: "Best not to disturb her"
 sacramental_events.62.t: "Detoxifying the masses"
 sacramental_events.62.d: "According to Tayr spiritualism, humans gather toxins from the negative energies of the world. These toxins build up and bloat their aura. This fact of life has led many different Theanite realms to perform acts of mass detoxification in order to maintain a pure society. Usually, many energy channelers work together to gather the toxins of the realm into a single host. This host is a specially selected channeler called a “wiipow” who holds an especially strong aura. The channelers will then attempt to purify the wiipow, finally cleansing the entire realm’s toxins in a single ceremony. While this is the standard path for purification, it is not the only one. Other realms simply send different seers throughout their realm in order to purify entire towns. Our people are starting to bear the signs of toxification, we must do something for their spiritual health."
 sacramental_events.62.a: "We must channel positive energy ourselves!"
 sacramental_events.62.b: "Send out the missionaries to detoxify"
 sacramental_events.62.c: "They must purify themselves"
 sacramental_events.63.t: "Negative energy from alliance"
 sacramental_events.63.d: "A collection of different royal seers have brought to our attention that one of our allies is outputting negative energy. In Theanism, seers undergo complex rituals in order to become attuned with sensing auras which makes their claims very troubling. If our ally is outputting negative energy, that means they could become a spiritual liability if we are to fight with them in war. We must make a statement on this negative energy to the people of the realm, so that they can account for it in their own prayers. While this will not spell the end for our alliance, it will certainly strain our ally’s opinion of us."
 sacramental_events.63.a: "I felt it."
 sacramental_events.64.t: "Gem Shortage"
 sacramental_events.64.d: "Crystals are vitally important to many rituals and prayers in Theanism. Specially trained seers, known as attuners, use crystals to store different emotions as well as positive energy. Different types of crystals also carry a natural energy within them, which is usually saved for healing and then replaced with whatever the attuned wishes to store. Attuners are vital during conflicts, as stored courage can be used to embolden a realm’s forces during battle. With all this in mind, a shortage of crystals would no doubt be devastating for our realm. We now find ourselves facing this particular struggle as our realm’s supplies start to dwindle. We must do something quickly to ensure that we do not run out of this vital good."
 sacramental_events.64.a: "We must import them"
 sacramental_events.64.b: "Search for some!"
 sacramental_events.64.c: "We will go without them"
 sacramental_events.65.t: "Nightmare Spirit Journey"
 sacramental_events.65.d: "Often, a realm’s ruler will undertake a spirit journey in order to better understand themselves and their place within the universe. Surrounded by different seers, a ruler will drink a sacred mixture of different mushrooms and ascend beyond their grounded form. As a being of pure energy, they will travel throughout the heavens and commune with the divine. During a routine spirit journey, our ruler was stricken by a strong wave of negative energy. The blissful experience quickly turned into a nightmare as our ruler was trapped in a trance. When they eventually awoke, they were weak and littered with scars on their aura. A spiritually damaged ruler can pose many problems for our realm."
 sacramental_events.65.a: "Horror!"
 sacramental_events.66.t: "Positive Spirit Journey"
 sacramental_events.66.d: "Often, a realm’s ruler will undertake a spirit journey in order to better understand themselves and their place within the universe. Surrounded by different seers, a ruler will drink a sacred mixture of different mushrooms and ascend beyond their grounded form. As a being of pure energy, they will travel throughout the heavens and commune with the divine. During a routine spirit journey, our ruler was stricken by a strong wave of positive energy. The seers that attended the ritual attest that our ruler began to float and shine brighter than the sun. When they eventually awoke, their aura was stronger than even. A spiritually strong ruler will no doubt lead our realm into a prosperous future."
 sacramental_events.66.a: "We are enlightened"
 sacramental_events.67.t: "A battle of energies"
 sacramental_events.67.d: "In Theanite realms, war is seens as a spiritual conflict as well as a physical one. All aspects of Tayr spiritualism are employed in order to ensure victory. Channelers gather negative energy and redirect it towards the enemy, attuners use their crystals to embolden soldiers, and psychics use their clairvoyance to predict enemy tactics. Now that we find ourselves at war with another realm, we must ensure that all aspects of our state are geared towards a spiritual victory."
 sacramental_events.67.a: "Call upon all seers to channel!"
 sacramental_events.67.b: "We must divide and conquer"
 sacramental_events.67.c: "Our practices should not be used for war!"
 sacramental_events.68.t: "Age of Wonders, not miracles"
 sacramental_events.68.d: "In this new modern age, many in our society have started to become disillusioned with their faith. The rampant progress of science and philosophy has made our ancient traditions out to be some antiquated relic of the past. Many have posited that aspects of our faith, like the channeling of energies and balance of nature, are based on superstition and mysticism rather than the new fad of rationalism. While we have fervently denied these claims, many in our own populace have slowly become accustomed to them. In a world without miracles, the power of our own church begins to fade. Theanism has provided our society with generations of stability, we must ensure that it continues to flourish even in these challenging times."
 sacramental_events.68.a: "We will endure"
 sacramental_events.69.t: "Scientific Theanism"
 sacramental_events.69.d: "A solution to our crisis of faith has presented itself in a new movement: Scientific Theanism. This movement does not seek to abandon the old traditions of our religion, but instead justify them through the sciences of our day. Theories of evolution meld with the concept of an Earth Mother who is actively involved in the world’s health. Theories of electricity, an unseeable energy which is found surrounding all things, meld with the concept of auras and positive or negative energies. These modern notions only parrot our own beliefs under different names. Most Scientific Theanites attempt to avoid or modify the old rituals to focus on a belief more grounded in the emerging discoveries. Adopting this shift in the faith and promoting its spread would free us from this spiritual rut. The only question is whether we honestly believe its tenents."
 sacramental_events.69.a: "This is a new path forward"
 sacramental_events.69.b: "We must stay with nature"
 sacramental_events.70.t: "Updating Heavenly Worship"
 sacramental_events.70.d: "There is still much work to be done in the wake of our nation’s commitment to scientific Theanism. Many throughout the land still practice the traditional ways of Theanism. While this is perfectly fine from a theological perspective, having a backwards populace damages the view of our faith in the wider world. We must ensure that these people are educated to the proper form of practice to ensure that Theanism can continue to flourish under our new system."
 sacramental_events.70.a: "They must be made aware"
 sacramental_events.70.b: "They are free to practice"
 sacramental_events.71.t: "Traditionalist Backlash"
 sacramental_events.71.d: "Adopting Scientific Theanism has brought many boons to our state, yet there are many who wish to see a return to the traditional beliefs. Scientific Theanism has moved us further away from our Sacramental roots, which has done much to anger those who align much closer to Ogdonian and Ecclesial worship than Tayr spiritualism. These people have started to coalesce into different groups and now seek to challenge our government. All across the nation, these traditionalists are beginning to rise up and destroy our progress. We must ensure that they are dealt with in a swift manner before they cause more havoc."
 sacramental_events.71.a: "Horror!"
 sacramental_events.72.t: "Hardline Sacramentalists"
 sacramental_events.72.d: "The practice of Theanism varies heavily depending on the region. Closer to the traditional Metis heartland in Kiikiwaahk, Tayr spiritualism is much more present in everyday life. The further away one travels from the Metis heartland, the more Sacramental practices play a role in everyday life. In our own realm, a branch of Sacramental extremists have begun to evangelize their faith. These Sacramentals embrace some parts of Tayr spiritualism, like positive and negative energies, but reject others as heresy. In addition, they believe that the council of Ogden is the only body which can rule on matters of the faith. Their heretical beliefs are damaging the faith of our people, we must do something in order to ensure that our populace remains pure."
 sacramental_events.72.a: "Let them practice as they wish"
 sacramental_events.72.b: "We must correct their negative energy"
 sacramental_events.72.c: "They must be supressed!"
 sacramental_events.73.t: "Maintaining her Garden"
 sacramental_events.73.d: "The Heavenly Mother maintains the earth which the Heavenly Father created. This is the fundamental belief which brands Theanites as a separate Sacramental branch from the Ecclesial and Ogdonian faiths. The Earth Mother, as she is sometimes called, breathes life into the landscape and ensures that the world remains in harmony. As children of our actions, it would be rude of us to stand idle while and not assist in her task. Setting aside a portion of land to maintain and grow will no doubt lighten her burden. If we can afford to do so, we must."
 sacramental_events.73.a: "Ensure it is protected"
 sacramental_events.73.b: "Populate the area"
 sacramental_events.74.t: "Accusations of Greed"
 sacramental_events.74.d: "Emotions play a major role in Theanism. Positive emotions are composed of positive energy, which can be bent and channeled into different beings. Likewise, negative emotions can similarly be moved. These different energies can taint or benefit one’s aura and their judgment. Greed is seen as a form of envy, which is a negative emotion. For this reason, Theanites have often avoided the collection of worldly riches in order to remain spiritually pure. Recently, our ruler has been accused of holding greed in their aura. We must investigate this and see how much truth the claim holds."
 sacramental_events.74.a: "Me? Of course not!"
 sacramental_events.74.b: "Tax whoever said that"
 sacramental_events.75.t: "Opening our third eye"
 sacramental_events.75.d: "One of the pivotal steps to becoming a Theanite seer is the opening of one’s third eye. This is typically done through a complex ritual involving multiple experienced channelers during which an individual becomes enlightened to the true nature of the world. Of course, it is rare for a ruler to embark on such a difficult spiritual journey due to the potential ramifications of its failure. However, we are different from those that have come before us. Having the Heavenly Mother’s grand design revealed to us would no doubt greatly improve our ability to care for her domain. However, if this ritual were to go wrong, we would be permanently damaged and in no shape to rule. We must decide our next steps carefully and under our Mother’s guidance."
 sacramental_events.75.a: "We will undergo the process"
 sacramental_events.75.b: "Nonsense!"
 sacramental_events.76.t: "Preparing the Ceremony"
 sacramental_events.76.d: "The ceremony for opening a seer’s eye is complicated, requiring lots of manpower and materials. Four channelers, three psychics, and seven attuners must be present in order to ensure that our ruler has the proper spiritual protection. The attuners require an expensive mix of different crystals which they use to store positive energy. The channelers must constantly bend this energy around the seer in order to keep a constant spiritual environment around the prospective seer. Finally, the psychics must constantly focus through this storm of energy to ensure that the seer’s aura remains properly balanced. All of this effort, combined with the expensive mushrooms of the awakening broth, will carve a large chunk out of our royal coffers. If the cost is too heavy we could, of course, simply skip out on some of the protection and buy from shadier sources."
 sacramental_events.76.a: "We must ensure sucess"
 sacramental_events.76.b: "Maybe some corners can be cut"
 sacramental_events.76.c: "The heavenly mother will protect us"
 sacramental_events.77.t: "Third Eye Opened"
 sacramental_events.77.d: "The room was thick with smoke and clustered with different people. [Root.Monarch.GetName] kneeled down before a small table and picked up a small bowl of broth. After a few gulps, the bowl was empty and the ceremony began. Immediately, the attuners brought out their different crystals and began to pull the energy out of them. The channelers then picked up their energy and began to whip up a storm around [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Over the course of an hour, the psychics monitored our ruler before they entered into the trance. A colorful static bled across the room, faces melded into walls and the crystaline structure of reality was revealed to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Then, it all fell apart. [Root.Monarch.GetName] lost themselves in the complexity of it all and began to drift away. They forgot who they were and what the world was. Eons passed in the matter of seconds, which gave [Root.Monarch.GetName] time to think. In an act of willpower, they forced open their third eye and saw the true nature of reality. The Earth Mother, the heavenly father, the holy spirit, Jesus, the tales of the Scriptures, and the end of days all flashes before [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Just as suddenly as it began, it ended. Snapped back into their body, [Root.Monarch.GetName] slowly rose to their feet and the ceremony ended. "
 sacramental_events.77.a: "Enlightenment"
 sacramental_events.78.t: "Third Eye Shut"
 sacramental_events.78.d: "The room was thick with smoke and clustered with different people. [Root.Monarch.GetName] kneeled down before a small table and picked up a small bowl of broth. After a few gulps, the bowl was empty and the ceremony began. Immediately, the attuners brought out their different crystals and began to pull the energy out of them. The channelers then picked up their energy and began to whip up a storm around [Root.Monarch.GetName].

[Root.Monarch.GetName] lost themselves in the complexity of it all and began to drift away. They forgot who they were and what the world was. Demons from the hells below tormented [Root.Monarch.GetName], telling lies about the truth of the world. They chastised [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s arrogance, thinking that they could have been seers. For Eons, [Root.Monarch.GetName] experienced this torture before the the psychics intervened and brought them out of the trance."
 sacramental_events.78.a: "Forever Changed"
 sacramental_events.79.t: "Psychic Procession"
 sacramental_events.79.d: "Psychics are a specialized type of seer which has further trained in the practice of reading auras. Through picking up on different changes in an aura’s energy a psychic can gain insight into a person’s behaviors and thoughts. Psychics use this insight to predict someone’s future actions in a practice called clairvoyance. Several prominent psychics have asked our ruler to fund a psychic procession, during which these psychics would use their aura reading abilities to convince heretics and heathens of Theanism’s authenticity. Seeing as our realm is currently experiencing a lack of religious unity, a procession would be helpful to consolidate our realm under a single faith."
 sacramental_events.79.a: "A worthwhile investment"
 sacramental_events.79.b: "Unecessary"
 sacramental_events.80.t: "Horoscope Prediction"
 sacramental_events.80.d: "The Horoscope Organization is a collection of hundreds of different seers from across the Theanite world who come together to create comprehensive horoscopes for the future of nations. The shadowy organization has predicted major events throughout history, such as the collapse of the American empire and the rise of Islam. Recently, the Organization has put out a bulletin which states that we are predicted to win this conflict. While their predictions are not always correct, the announcement will no doubt give our soldiers the courage to carry on the fight."
